# Annotate The Bastards!

This is the repo of the now not working mobile app called Annotate The Bastards!

It was running on an old Heroku service they killed so I grabbed the repo and put
a static page up in its place.  One of these days I'll get around to making it all
work again.

This is the Rails app that built it. Be warned, some of this code is
downright terrible!

## Old Details:

Annotate The [Bastards!][fb] was a mobile web app that worked as an
alternate interface to display the detailed annotations for
the novels of [William][nv] [Gaddis][wp] that can be found on [williamgaddis.org][wg].

While reading [JR][jr] I found it difficult to use the annotations on [williamgaddis.org][wg]
on anything other than a full computer with monitor, and that is just not ideal.  I
pulled together this mobile web app so that I could use my iPhone to read along with the novel.

Built by [Nicholas Fine][nf] with [Ruby on Rails][rr] and [jQuery Mobile][jq] and once hosted on [Heroku][h].
