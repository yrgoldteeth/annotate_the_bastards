            Agape:</strong> agap<strong>&eacute;</strong> is Greek for &#8220;brotherly 
            love&#8221; and was used by early Christian writers first as a term 
            to describe their &#8220;love feasts&#8221; (see p. 37) and later 
            to distinguish communal, altruistic love from eros, sexual love. Regarding

            attained celebrity in 1812 with the publication of the first two cantos 
            of <em>Childe Harold&#8217;s Pilgrimage</em>, and thereafter was as 
            famous for his scandalous lifestyle as for his poetry. See 67-68 below.</font></p>

            describes this world in the opening pages of his preface (7-8), i.e., &#8220;a universe in which everything happened precisely according 
            to law, a compact, tightly organized universe in which the whole future 
            depends strictly upon the whole past. . . . The Newtonian view, however, 
            was compelled to state and formulate physics as if it were, in fact, 
            subject to such laws. This is now no longer the dominating view of 
            physics. . . .&#8221;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>2.20] aporia:</strong> literally &#8220;impassable 
            path&#8221;: a term used in deconstruction criticism, especially in 
            Jacques Derrida&#8217;s theory of <em>diff&eacute;rance</em>, to indicate 
            an impasse or conflict between rhetoric and thought. In his 1987 book 
            on Derrida, Christopher Norris defined this aspect of deconstruction 
            as &#8220;the seeking-out of those &#8216;aporias,&#8217; blindspots 
            or moments of self-contradiction where a text involuntarily betrays 
            the tension between rhetoric and logic, between what it manifestly 
            means to say and what it is nonetheless constrained to mean.&#8221; 
            Gaddis discovered this word in Michiko Kakutani&#8217;s review of 
            historian Gertrude Himmelfarb&#8217;s <em>On Looking into the Abyss</em>, 
            <em>New York Times</em>, 1 March 1984, C19; Kakutani quotes Himmelfarb&#8217;s 
            synoyms for the word: &#8220;difference, discontinuity, disparity, 
            contradiction, discord, ambiguity, irony, paradox, perversity, opacity, 
            obscurity, anarchy, chaos.&#8221; Cf. <em>RSP</em> 92.</font></p>

            a short but key work in which Freud examines drives and instincts, 
            especially the death instinct. In his <em>Freud: The Man and the Cause</em> (Cape, 1980), Ronald W. Clark notes: &#8220;To his mother he was &#8216;my

            the Swiss pastor and psychoanalyst Oskar Pfister (1873-1956), Freud 
            wrote: &#8220;I do not break my head very much about good and evil, 
            but I have found little that is &#8216;good&#8217; about human beings 
            on the whole. In my experience most of them are trash, no matter whether 
            they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none 
            at all. . . . If we are to talk of ethics, I subscribe to a high ideal 
            from which most of the human beings I have come across depart most 
            lamentably&#8221; (<em>Psychoanalysis and Faith: The Letters of Sigmund 
            Freud and Oskar Pfister</em>, ed Heinrich Meng and Ernst L. Freud 
            [London: Hogarth, 1963], 61-62). </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.5] Bentham ... the same&#8221;:</strong> 
            Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), English jurist and philosopher; the famous 
            quotation is from his <em>The Rationale of Reward</em> (1825) as misquoted 
            by John Stuart Mill in his essay &#8220;Bentham&#8221; (<em>London 
            and Westminster Review</em>, 1838). Mill quotes Bentham as saying &#8220;somewhere in his works&#8221; that, &#8220;quantity of pleasure 
            being equal, push-pin is as good as poetry,&#8221; whereas Bentham 
            wrote, &#8220;Prejudice apart, the game of push-pin is of equal value 
            with the arts and sciences of music and poetry.&#8221; Echoing Plato 
            and anticipating Tolstoy (as quoted later in <em>AA</em>), Bentham 
            goes on to say: &#8220;If the game of push-pin furnish more pleasure, 
            it is more valuable than either. Everybody can play at push-pin: poetry 
            and music are relished only by a few. The game of push-pin is always 
            innocent: it were well could the same be always asserted of poetry. 
            Indeed, between poetry and truth there is natural opposition: false 
            morals and fictitious nature. The poet always stands in need of something 
            false. When he pretends to lay his foundations in truth, the ornaments 
            of his superstructure are fictions; his business consists in stimulating 
            our passions, and exciting our prejudices. Truth, exactitude of every 
            kind, is fatal to poetry. The poet must see everything through coloured 
            media, and strive to make every one else do the same. It is true, 
            there have been noble spirits, to whom poetry and philosophy have 
            been equally indebted; but these exceptions do not counteract the 
            mischiefs which have resulted from this magic art. If poetry and music 
            deserve to be preferred before a game of push-pin, it must be because 
            they are calculated to gratify those individuals who are most difficult 
            to be pleased.&#8221;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.9] the all-or-none machine Norbert 
            Wiener called it: </strong>see Wiener 64.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.11] Wiener tells us about a brilliant 
            American engineer</strong>: Downplaying American &#8220;know-how,&#8221; 
            Wiener says it&#8217;s more important to have &#8220;know-what,&#8221; 
            or purpose: &#8220;I can distinguish between the two by an example. 
            Some years ago, a prominent American engineer bought an expensive 
            player-piano. It became clear after a week or two that this purchase 
            did not correspond to any particular interest in the music played 
            by the piano but rather to an overwhelming interest in the piano mechanism. 
            For this gentleman, the player-piano was not a means of producing 
            music, but a means of giving some inventor the chance of showing how 
            skillful he was at overcoming certain difficulties in the production 
            of music. This is an estimable attitude in a second-year high-school 
            student. How estimable it is in one of those on whom the whole cultural 
            future of the country depends, I leave to the reader&#8221; (183). </font></p>

            the idea for the instrument came to him while fighting in the Civil 
            War. After ten years of work, he unveiled the first model in 1876. 
            Thereafter he had trouble convincing people he was the true inventor 
            of the player piano: &#8220;Like Christ,&#8221; he wrote (adapting

            &#8220;Pindar takes his inspiration from Homer in speaking of the 
            animated statues of the island of Rhodes, famous for its smiths, as 
            also was Crete. He mentions them in some lines, admittedly none too 
            clear, of the <em>7th Olympiad</em>. The god who is giving light to 
            men, says Pindar, stipulated that an altar be raised to the goddess 
            of the sea-green eyes. She granted them the privilege &#8216;of triumphing 
            in all the arts over other men, and their roads knew figures like 
            those of living men walking. The art that science engenders knows 
            how to augment and embellish without recourse to deceit.&#8217; The 
            poet contrasts this innocent art with dubious magic&#8221; (17). </font></p>

            or even exclusively reserved for erotic relationships falling outside 
            the social norm&#8221; (43).<br>

            my book! Pascal had a nail-studded belt he used to lean against every 
            time he felt pleasure at some word of praise. I should have a belt 
            like that. I ask you, be a friend; either do not write to me about 
            the book at all, or else write and tell me everything that is wrong 
            with it. If it is true, as I feel, that my powers are weakening, then, 
            I beg of you, tell me. Our profession is dreadful, writing corrupts

            (100). In the <em>Theaetetus</em> Socrates refers to &#8220;Memory,

            not; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking vision.&#8221;<br>

            <strong>73.7] letter Wagner wrote to R&ouml;ckel:</strong> &#8220;We 
            must learn to die, in fact to die in the most absolute sense of the 
            world; the fear of the end is the source of all lovelessness and it 
            arises only where love itself has already faded. How did it come about 
            that mankind so lost touch with this bringer of the highest happiness 
            to everything living that in the end everything they did, everything 
            they undertook and established, was done solely out of fear for the 
            end. My poem shows how. It shows nature in its undistorted truth, 
            with all its opposites intact, which in their manifold and endless 
            permutations also contain elements which are mutually exclusive and 
            self-repelling.&#8221;&#8212;letter to August R&ouml;ckel dated 25/26 
            January 1854, in <em>Wagner: A Documentary Study</em>, ed. Herbert 
            Barth, Dietrich Mack, Egon Voss (London: Thames and Hudson, 1975), 
            184. {John Soutter}<br>
            <br>
            <strong>73.12] Levochka:</strong> the diminutive (familiar) form of 
            Tolstoy&#8217;s first name Lev (though Troyat spells it &#8220;Lyovochka&#8221;).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>73.13] Pozdnyshev in The Kreutzer Sonata:</strong> Pozdnyshev 
            is the protagonist of Tolstoy&#8217;s 1889 novella (named after Beethoven&#8217;s 
            1802 violin sonata). After horrifying an idealistic lady on the train 
            by telling her that marriage is &#8220;nothing but copulation,&#8221; Pozdnyshev recounts to a sympathetic passanger the story of his disastrous 
            marriage. After a shameful and dull honeymoon, Pozdnyshev and his 
            wife endure a loveless marriage until he kills her with a dagger in 
            a fit of jealousy.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>75.5] violinist Trukhachev ... like Hottentots:</strong> Pozdnyshev 
            describes Trukhachevski thus: &#8220;His figure was weak though not 
            misshapen, and he had a specially developed posterior, like a woman&#8217;s, 
            or such as Hottentots are said to have. They too are reported to be 
            musical&#8221; (chap. 19).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>75.11] &#8220;the most refined form of sensual lust&#8221;:</strong> Pozdnyshev&#8217;s description of music in chap. 24, taken not from 
            the old Maude translation that Gaddis uses above (which reads &#8220;that 
            most exquisite voluptuousness of the senses&#8221;) but from that 
            of David McDuff in <em>The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories</em> 
            (Penguin, 1983).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>75.14] That description you put in somewhere Pozdnyshev ... 
            able to do:</strong> from chap. 23. This passage is repeated at the 
            conclusion of <em>AA</em>. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>75.21] you can play better by roll than many who play by hand:</strong> 
            from the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> ad quoted earlier (Roehl 23).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>76.8] banish Homer:</strong> Socrates&#8217; reluctant conclusion 
            in the <em>Republic</em>; &#8220;we are ready to acknowledge that 
            Homer is the greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers; but we 
            must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises 
            of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into 
            our State&#8221; (10:607a).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>76.11] first movement of The Kreutzer Sonata ... lowcut dresses:</strong> stating that music &#8220;is a terrible instrument in the hands of 
            any chance user&#8221; because of its agitating effect, Pozdnyshev 
            says, &#8220;Take that Kreutzer Sonata, for instance, how can that 
            first presto be played in a drawing-room among ladies in low-necked 
            dresses?&#8221; (chap. 23). <br>
            <br>
            <strong>77.2] Kleist ... H&ouml;lderlin:</strong> Heinrich von Kleist 
            (1777-1811), German dramatist, and Friedrich H&ouml;lderlin (1770-1843), 
            German lyric poet.<br>
            <strong><br>
            77.3] most agonizing of them all: </strong>Nietzsche suffered a mental 
            breakdown in 1889 and spent a year in an asylum; the last ten years 
            of his life were spent in a mental twilight, attended by his sister 
            Elisabeth; after Nietzsche&#8217;s death in 1900 she secured the rights 
            to his work and published his literary remains in mangled form. For 
            the sordid details, see H. F. Peters&#8217;s <em>Zarathustra&#8217;s 
            Sister: The Case of Elisabeth and Friedrich Nietzsche</em> (NY: Crown, 
            1977). <br>
            <br>
            <strong>77.17] his most famous friend:</strong> Wagner, whom Nietzsche 
            championed in his first book (see below) but repudiated in later life.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>78.6] The Will to Power:</strong> a book begun by Nietzsche 
            in 1888, but never finished. His sister published his notes for the 
            project in 1901.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>78.7] blond beast and ruthlessly distorted superman:</strong> two terms from Nietzsche&#8217;s writings that have been misinterpreted 
            as praise for Nazi-Aryan superiority. The &#8220;blond beast&#8221; appears in his <em>On the Genealogy of Morals</em> (part 1, sec. 11), 
            where the image of a lion is used to refer not to 19th-century Germans 
            but to certain ancient Greeks and Romans, Goths and Vandals, even 
            Arab and Japanese nobility. Nietzsche&#8217;s superman&#8212;more 
            properly translated &#8220;overman&#8221; (&Uuml;bermensch)&#8212;was 
            introduced in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> (1883) and signifies 
            a man who gives &#8220;his life meaning by raising himself above the 
            animals and the all-too-human,&#8221; according to Walter Kaufmann. 
            &#8220;What else is human nature but a euphemism for inertia, cultural 
            conditioning, and what we are before we make something of ourselves? 
            Our so-called human nature is precisely what we should do well to 
            overcome; and the man who has overcome it Zarathustra calls the overman&#8221; (<em>The Portable Nietzsche</em> (NY: Viking, 1954], 115). It certainly 
            didn&#8217;t refer to his fellow Germans, of whom Nietzsche was generally 
            contemptuous, or Nazi-Aryan supremacists. Cf. Nietzsche&#8217;s &Uuml;bermensch 
            with Gaddis&#8217;s Self Who Could Do More.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>78.11] The Birth of Tragedy:</strong> Nietzsche&#8217;s first 
            book (1872), in which he argues that Greek tragedy was born from the 
            union of the constructive, beautiful, rational (Apollinian) and destructive, 
            grotesque, irrational (Dionysian) tendencies of Greek civilization. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>79.21] Beautiful little innocent climbs into my lap fell on 
            my neck with kisses:</strong> unidentified.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>79.24] my sometime daughter:</strong> Lear condemns Cordelia 
            thus (1.1.119), &#8220;sometime&#8221; meaning &#8220;former.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            <strong>80.8] the ceremony of innocence was drowned:</strong> from 
            Yeats&#8217;s poem &#8220;The Second Coming&#8221;: &#8220;The ceremony 
            of innocence is drowned; / The best lack all conviction, while the 
            worst / Are full of passionate intensity.&#8221; Cf. <em>FHO</em> 
            304.23.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>80.9] can you pull a shade over there:</strong> in an earlier 
            version of <em>AA</em> Gaddis planned to have his narrator accompanied 
            by a character based on Lear&#8217;s Fool, and it is apparently that 
            character who is addressed here. Cf. Lear&#8217;s request &#8220;Make 
            no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains&#8221; (3.6.76), though 
            it&#8217;s hard to say whether this is addressed to Kent or the Fool.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>80.12] weightless shadows the chorus held up to Ajax:</strong> from Sophocles&#8217; play <em>Ajax</em>?<br>
            <br>
            <strong>80.21] the artist as confidence man:</strong> cf. Melville&#8217;s 
            novel <em>The Confidence-Man</em> (1857).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>81.1] Torschlusspanik: </strong>a German word meaning the 
            fear of closed doors, of opportunities missed. (See annotation to 
            <em>J R</em> 393.42.) Torschlusspanik is also the title of the radio 
            play version of <em>AA</em> that was broadcast by DeutschlandRadio 
            in 1999.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>81.6] Levochka&#8217;s sensual lust ... safety valve of sex: </strong>Pozdnyshev uses the safety-valve metaphor in chap. 7 and 
            11 of &#8220;The Kreutzer Sonata.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            <strong>81.15] verweile doch! du bist so sch&ouml;n:</strong> see 
            17.16 above.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>81.23] voice has dwindled to the dry scratch of a grasshopper:</strong> Eliot? (see chirping grasshopper in &#8220;Ash Wednesday&#8221;) <br>
            <br>
            <strong>82.6] Mel-O-Dee Music Rolls, Mel-O-Art:</strong> two manufacturers 
            of player piano rolls mentioned by Roehl (167-71).<br>
            <br>

            QRS Music Company made both player pianos and piano rolls; Roehl (155) 
            reproduces a newspaper article headlined: &#8220;Q R S Music Co. Launches 
            Campaign Against Filth in Popular Songs with Vigorous Circular Letter.&#8221; 
            (These were probably what Roehl calls &#8220;the inevitable &#8216;party 
            rolls&#8217; with suggestive verses which hit the market in the &#8217;20&#8217;s&#8221; [154]).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>82.13] &#8220;the little people ... they laugh too&#8221;:</strong> from Robinson Jeffers&#8217; poem &#8220;Wise Men in Their Bad Hours,&#8221; also quoted in <em>CG</em>. <br>

            of Flaubert&#8217;s <em>Letters</em> 1857-1880 is one from de Maupassant 
            to Turgenev, dated 25 May 1880, two weeks after Flaubert&#8217;s death: 
            &#8220;At three-thirty in the afternoon on Saturday, May eighth, I 
            received a telegram from Mme Commanville: &#8216;Flaubert apoplexy.

            Buffalo, New York, murdered his wife in 1889, and on 6 August 1890 
            died in the electric chair, invented by Thomas Alva Edison to demonstrate 
            the dangers of using Alternating Current (he favored Direct Current).<br>

            <strong>87.6] In Germany the Ariston player ... no pneumatics:</strong> &#8220;Meanwhile the following important developments were taking 
            place in Germany. The Ariston player was patented by Paul Ehrlich 
            in 1887. This thirty-six note mechanism was soon superseded by that 
            of Ludwig Hupfeld, playing sixty-one notes; Hupfeld&#8217;s device 
            could be inserted into a previously built upright, and his compass 
            was increased to seventy-six notes in 1889. These were without pneumatics

            Melograph and Melotrope:</strong> &#8220;The first man to find a satisfactory 
            method of utilising air was J[ules]. Carpentier, who constructed his 
            first pneumatic automatophonic instruments for the international electricity 
            exhibition in 1880. His repeating melograph, first used for the harmonium, 
            punched holes directly in paper strips which were then used to play 
            the music in a specially constructed harmonium worked by electricity. 
            From an improved type Carpentier developed two more instruments in 
            1887, the melograph and the melotrope, which he put before the French 
            Academy&#8221; (Buchner 34).</font></p>

            patented what appears to be the first player operating on pneumatic 
            principles. This he called the &#8216;Pianista,&#8217; and it formed 
            the basis of practically all later developments in the field&#8221; 
            (Roehl 2). The Pianista was introduced to American audiences at the 
            Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876. Loesser also notes Fourneaux&#8217;s

            became exceedingly popular, and upon expiration of the patent it was

            du Maurier&#8217;s 1891 metaphysical novel <em>Peter Ibbetson</em> 
            features an idealistic young free-thinker who loves music but was 
            never taught to read it, and who expresses his frustration in this 
            quotation from Part Third (the same quotation Crawley used in<em> 
            J R</em>, mistakenly attributing it to du Maurier&#8217;s better-known 
            novel <em>Trilby</em>, quoted below). In his unpublished essay &#8220;You&#8217;re 
            a Dog Gone Daisy Girl&#8212;Presto&#8221; (1946), Gaddis indicates 
            he learned of du Maurier&#8217;s novel from C. B. Chilton&#8217;s

            for a piano which could be played either automatically or by hand. 
            The mechanism operated at the rear end of the keys and was among the 
            first of those which did not interfere with the ordinary use of the 
            piano. It was called the Angelus Piano Player, and was introduced 
            by the inventor&#8217;s employers, Wilcox &amp; White Co., to whom 
            the patent was assigned&#8221; (Weir 66). <br>

            <strong>91.19] its author one day walking across Hampstead Heath with 
            Henry James:</strong> in the 1880s du Maurier discussed the idea for 
            <em>Trilby</em> with his young friend James, and later suggested that 
            the American novelist write it himself, but James declined, fearing 
            that his lack of musical knowledge would hinder him. (This anecdote, 
            including the detail of the two writers walking across Hampstead Heath, 
            opens Leonee Ormond&#8217;s introduction to the 1994 Everyman edition 
            of the novel, though Gaddis could have found the details elsewhere.) 
            Du Maurier went on to write the novel itself, which, upon publication 
            in 1895, became one of the first bestsellers of the modern era. It 
            features an artist&#8217;s model named Trilby O&#8217;Ferrall who 
            is hypnotized by the frustrated musician Svengali into becoming a 
            world-class singer. <br>

            the studio apartment in Paris occupied by Trilby&#8217;s three male 
            friends: &#8220;The big piano, a semi-grand by Broadwood, had arrived 
            from England by &#8216;the Little Quickness&#8217; (la Petite Vitesse, 
            as the goods trains are called in France), and lay, freshly tuned,

            <strong>92.1] the man once the best pianist of his time at the Leipzig 
            Conservatory:</strong> from du Maurier&#8217;s description of Svengali 
            in part 2 of Trilby, which Gaddis continues to paraphrase.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>92.10] Sigi ... paper on the psychological mechanism of hysteria:</strong> 
            early in his career Freud collaborated with Josef Breuer on the use 
            of hypnosis in the treatment of hysteria; their paper, <em>On the 
            Psychical Mechanism of Hysterical Phenomena</em> (1893, English trans. 
            1909), expanded in <em>Studien &uuml;ber Hysterie</em> (1895), marked 
            the beginnings of psychoanalysis in the discovery that the symptoms 
            of hysterical patients--directly traceable to psychic trauma in earlier 
            life--represent undischarged emotional energy. The work was poorly 
            received by the medical profession, and the two men soon separated 
            over Freud's growing conviction that the undefined energy was sexual 
            in nature.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>92.18] He passed a hand ... Svengali!:</strong> also from 
            part 2 of <em>Trilby</em>. Svengali turns Trilby into a kind of automaton 
            (to give voice to his own self-who-could-do-more), similar to the 
            doll created by Dr. Copp&eacute;lius in <em>Tales of Hoffmann</em>,

            with hypnosis. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>92.22] cri du coeur:</strong> Svengali is stunned by Trilby&#8217;s 
            &#8220;cry from the heart&#8221; (she bellows &#8220;Milk below&#8221; when in high spirits) and realizes the potential in her voice.<br>

            board:</strong> quoted directly from <em>Trilby</em> (with some elisions); 
            the Panth&eacute;on is the one in Paris, not in Rome.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>93.16] Offenbach&#8217;s one wish ... dolls by Spalanzani 
            ... sings herself to death:</strong> Jacques Offenbach began composing 
            his opera <em>Tales of Hoffmann</em> in 1877 (hence &#8220;a year 
            too late&#8221; for the watershed year 1876), but died four months 
            before its premiere in early 1881. In act 1, Hoffmann loves and loses 
            a woman named Olympia, who turns out to be a doll created by her &#8220;father&#8221; 
            Spalanzani and Dr. Copp&eacute;lius. In act 3, Hoffmann loves and 
            loses a woman named Antonia, who is warned that if she continues singing 
            she will die; the evil Dr. Miracle convinces her to sing anyway, and 
            she dies. Gaddis&#8217;s notes indicate his source was <em>The Victor 
            Book of the Opera</em> (1929).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>93.21] Svengali ... flageolet:</strong> these details are 
            revealed by Svengali&#8217;s friend Gecko at the end of the novel 
            after Trilby has died; a flageot is a kind of tin whistle Svengali 
            used to teach singing.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>93.24] Gott im Himmel! Wieder zur&uuml;ck!:</strong> &#8220;God 
            in heaven! Back again!&#8221; says Marta (Svengali&#8217;s aunt) as 
            Trilby begins singing again in part 8 just before she dies.<br>
            <strong><br>
            94.1] one note drawn through all the colors of the rainbow:</strong> also from Gecko&#8217;s story in part 8.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>95.19] the Impromptu:</strong> in part 1 of <em>Trilby</em>, 
            Svengali plays Chopin&#8217;s Impromptu in A Flat (1837) on the piano, 
            in part 6 Trilby performs a vocalized version, and in part 8 she sings 
            it and, like Antonia in <em>Tales of Hoffmann</em>, dies.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>95.20] age withering arrogant youth:</strong> in<em> R </em>(63, 
            938) Gaddis had quoted Enobarbus&#8217;s praise of Cleopatra: &#8220;Age 
            cannot wither her, nor custom stale / Her infinite variety&#8221; (<em>Antony and Cleopatra</em> 2.2.240-41).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>96.10] Youth with its reckless exuberance:</strong> in letters 
            written late in life, Gaddis often quoted a favorite line from Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>As You Like It</em> (3.4.39): &#8220;But all&#8217;s brave that 
            youth mounts, and folly guides.&#8221;<br>
