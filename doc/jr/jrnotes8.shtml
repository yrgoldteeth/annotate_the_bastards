          inhumanly butchered by the hands of Peter the reader, and a troop of 
          savage and merciless fanatics: her flesh was scraped from her bones

          the flames. The just progress of inquiry and punishment was stopped

  only mathematical work produced after retiring was
 the essay on the cycloid,<span style="font-family:&quot;New Century Schoolbook&quot;"> the
 curve traced by a point on the circumference of a rolling circle,</span> in
 1658. He was suffering from sleeplessness and toothache when the idea occurred
 to him, and to his surprise his teeth immediately ceased to ache. Regarding
 this as a divine intimation to proceed with the problem, he worked incessantly
 for eight days at it, and completed a tolerably full account of the geometry
 of the cycloid,

  solving the problem
          of the area of any segment of the cycloid and the center of gravity
          of any segment; he also solved the problems of the volume and surface
          area of the solid of revolution formed by rotating the cycloid about
        the x-axis. This and more about Pascal here<br>

              Eisen ruling:


 </span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;New Century Schoolbook&quot;">a Supreme
 Court decision handed down in June 1974. Here's a short article on its significance
 that appeared in <i>Time</i> magazine (10 June 1974), perhaps Gaddis's source, under
 the title "Taking Mass from Class": </span></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span style="font-family:&quot;New Century Schoolbook&quot;">"Class
                actions have sprouted and multiplied like the leaves of the green
                bay tree," groused Federal Appeals Judge Harold Medina in 1973.
                He had just heard one of the numerous appeals that have marked
                the course of the undisputed king of mass class actions: the
                complex lawsuit brought by New York Shoe Salesman Morton Eisen
                on behalf of all persons who had bought or sold odd lots of stock
                (less than 100 shares) on the New York Stock Exchange between
                1962 and 1966. Last week, eight years after Eisen was first filed,
                the Supreme Court handed down a final ruling on the suit -- and
                effectively defoliated Medina's bay tree. From now on, class
                actions on behalf of large numbers of plaintiffs who have each
                suffered similar small losses will have practically no chance
                of succeeding. <br>
              <br>
            </span><span style="font-family:&quot;New Century Schoolbook&quot;">In
                his suit, Eisen claimed that the two brokerage firms then in
            control of odd-lot trading -- Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin and DeCoppet &amp; Doremus
            -- had engaged in illegal price-fixing that slightly increased the
            fee for each transaction. Eisen figured that he himself was only
            entitled to $70 in damages, but the total possible damage award to
            the likely 2 million other potential members of the class was estimated
            to be at least $7.8 million. Eisen's problem was to satisfy a judge
            that the huge, unwieldy group of odd-lot traders could be managed
            under precise rules authorized by Congress. Those rules were designed
            to ensure that all potential members of a class actually share the
            same interest. One key provision: each class member must be notified
            about the suit so that he may opt out or hire a lawyer to represent
            his viewpoint. <br>
        <br>
        Bad Burden. With millions of possible Eisen members, it was little wonder
        that one judge pronounced the suit a "Frankenstein monster posing as a class
        action." Lower
        courts ruling on Eisen's suit did seek to interpret the rules as liberally
        as possible so that narrow technicalities would not derail an otherwise valid
        consumer claim. But the Supreme Court Justices last week concluded unanimously
        that the plaintiff had to give individual notice to "all class members who
        can be identified with reasonable effort." The requirement, said Justice
        Lewis Powell for the court, "is
        not a discretionary consideration to be waived in a particular case." Furthermore,
        said Powell, the plaintiff must bear the costs of notification. <br>
        <br>
        The twin requirements impose a crushing burden. For Eisen, such costs could
        come to $272,000. If he were later to win, he could recover that expense
        as well as damages, but the initial outlay would have been prohibitive for
        a shoe salesman who makes $300 a week. <br>
        <br>
        The ruling still leaves open the possibility of smaller class actions, in
        which there are fewer and more easily accessible members. But the complex
        legal issues involved in many class actions often mean lawyers' fees that
        only a large number of plaintiffs can afford. "In a sense," says Attorney
        Raymond Bonner of Public Citizens Litigation Group, "what's happened here
        is that it's better for business to cheat a million people out of a dollar
        each than to cheat one person out of $1 million." Which is to say that suits
        like Eisen's, which have attacked hotel overcharges, credit-card finance
        charges and preferential air-fare charges for youths, are now apparently
        out of the question for all but the very wealthy. </span><b><span style="font-family:&quot;New Century Schoolbook&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
