                lectured to them on the Ethics of Art. I read them passages from
                the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini and they seemed much delighted.

Suddenly it occurred to me that in all my hopes and imaginings of a first night I had never got near the reality: silent the man lay there, jiggling, jiggling. Suddenly I burst out laughing: it was too wretched, too absurd!
