                  the inclination of suspenders to twist and of hooks to forsake

Taine, who always disliked windy rhetoric, remarked quietly, 'The only axis in my knowledge round which everything moves to some accomplishment is a woman's cunt (<em>le con d'une femme</em>)&quot; (197). <span style="font-family:&quot;New Century Schoolbook&quot;"><o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
