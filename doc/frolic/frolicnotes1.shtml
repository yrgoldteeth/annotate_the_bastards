      <td colspan="2" valign="top"><strong>title) <i>A Frolic of His Own</i>: </strong>a legal 
        phrase that Gaddis found in Prosser: “In 1834 Baron Parke uttered the 
        classic phrase, that a master is not liable for the torts of his servant 
        who is not at all on his master’s business, but is ‘going on a frolic 
        of his own’” (461). Cf. Harry’s explanation (398) and Judge Crease’s comment 
        on this phrase (429.34-35). Gaddis originally planned to call the novel 
        <i>The Last Act, </i>but changed his mind shortly before the book was 
        finished. <font face="Times New Roman"> <b> <br>

        Money damages meant to compensate the plaintiff for the harm he has suffered 
        constitute the principal remedy applied by modern courts.&nbsp; “An economic 
        loss can be compensated in kind by an economic gain; but recovery for 
        non-economic losses such as pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of 
        life rests on ‘the legal fiction that money damages can compensate for 
        the victim’s injury.’ (<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Howard v. Lecher</span></i>,

        knowing that although money will neither ease the pain nor restore the 
        victim’s abilities, this device is as close as the law can come in its 
        effort to right the wrong.&nbsp; We have no hope of evaluating what has 
        been lost, but a monetary award may provide a measure of solace for the 
        condition created.”&nbsp; <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">McDougal

          <O:P> A largely apocryphal tale, well in place by 1808 when Franz Xaver 
          Niemetschek published a biography of Mozart in which he wrote:

          <div class="Section2"> 
            <div align="left">&quot;Shortly before the Coronation of the Emperor 
              Leopold, and before Mozart received the commission to go to Prague, 
              an unsigned letter was handed to him by an unknown messenger which, 
              with many flattering remarks, contained the question whether Mozart 
              would like to undertake the composition of a Requiem, for what price, 
              and how soon he would be able to deliver it. <br>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div align="left" class="Section2">&quot;Mozart, who was accustomed 
            to take no step without consulting his wife, related to her this strange 
            commission, and at the same time mentioned his desire to try his hand 
            at this type of work too, the more so as the elevated and exalted 
            style of church music was always close to his genius. She advised 
            him to accept the commission. He therefore wrote to the unknown gentleman 
            to say that he would write the Requiem for a certain sum; he could 
            not exactly state the time he would require to complete it; but he 
            would like to know the destination to which he was to deliver the 
            work when it was finished. The same messenger shortly reappeared, 
            bringing not only the agreed honorarium with him, but also the promise 
            that, as he had been so reasonable in his price, he would receive 
            a generous additional payment on handing over the work. He was moreover 
            to write according to the mood and frame of his mind, but he was not 
            to trouble to try and find out the name of his patron, for this search 
            would certainly be in vain....&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>

          <p><b>29.2&nbsp;(29.31) Baron Pollack in Byrne v. Boadle:</b> “The Latin 
            phrase [<i>res ipsa loquitur</i>], which means nothing more than ‘the 
            thing speaks for itself,’ is the offspring of a casual word of Baron 
            Pollock [<i>note correct spelling</i>] during argument with counsel 
            in a case [<i>footnote</i>: Byrne v. Boadle, 1863, 2 H. &amp; C. 722, 
            159 Eng. Rep. 299] in 1863 in which a barrel of flour rolled out of 
            a warehouse window and fell upon a passing pedestrian” –from William 
            L. Prosser’s <i>Law of Torts</i> (1941; 4<sup>th</sup> ed., 1971), 
            p. 213. This standard textbook for law students and lawyers was an 
            important source book for Gaddis. (This edition is cited at 291.2.)&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="black"><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;

            is the conventional label applied to events that are in themselves 
            so plainly the result of&nbsp;&nbsp; negligence they are legally presumed, 
            without further evidence of their causes, to establish liability.&nbsp; 
            “Negligence” is the failure of a person to conform to the standard 
            of care a “reasonable person” would conform to in doing what he was 
            doing.&nbsp; Thus, for example, it is presumed that if a barrel of 
            flour rolls out of a warehouse window, the person responsible for 
            its handling was negligent (and therefore liable for the damage caused 
            by his negligence).&nbsp; Another classic example of an event that 
            “speaks for itself” is the discovery of a surgical instrument inside 
            someone’s body long after the surgery, which is alone sufficient to 
            establish medical malpractice.</span></font></font><font face="Times New Roman"></font>

        <blockquote>
          <div class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">In 1877, Whistler 
            showed eight works at the Grosvenor Gallery, including &quot;Nocturne: 
            Blue and Gold - Old Battersea Bridge,&quot; ... and &quot;Nocturne 
            in Black and Gold - The Falling Rocket&quot; (The Detroit Institute 
            of Arts, gift of Dexter M. Ferry). In <i>Fors Clavigera</i>, Ruskin 
            wrote the following about the exhibition:</font></div>
          <div align="left" class="Section4"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sir 
            Coutts Lindsay ought not to have admitted works into the gallery in 
            which the ill-educated conceit of the artist so nearly approached 
            the aspect of wilful imposture. I have seen, and heard, much of Cockney 
            impudence before now; but never expected to hear a coxcomb ask two 
            hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face.&quot;</font></div>
          <div align="left" class="Section4"><font face="Times New Roman">Ruskin's 
            comments were reprinted in the <i>Spectator</i>, and Whistler sued 
            for libel. The catalogue provides the following commentary:</font></div>
          <div align="left" class="Section4"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The 
            case did not come to court until November 1878. Ruskin had had his 
            first mental collapse in February that year, and did not appear. His 
            instructions to his defence counsel were unrepentant: Whistler was 
            ill-educated because the price demanded was unjust, the analogy between 
            painting and music was misunderstood, the work was not art but ornament, 
            unfinished and empty of ideas. No work should leave an artist's hands 
            'which his diligence could further complete, or his reflection further 
            improve.'...Whistler dominated the trial with his witticisms, arguing 
            the case for art for art's sake....Nocture...Old Battersea Bridge, 
            which shows the profound influence of Japanese woodcuts on Whistler's 
            art, was produced in court. Asked if it was a 'correct representation,' 
            Whistler answered: 'It was not my intent simply to make a copy of 
            Battersea Bridge. The pier in the centre of the picture may not be 
            like the piers of Battersea Bridge. I did not intend to paint a portrait 
            of Battersea Bridge, but only a painting of a moonlight scene. As 
            to what the picture represents, that depends upon who looks at it.'...Whistler 
            won, but the derisory award of a farthing's damages without costs 
            led to his bankruptcy. Ruskin resigned his Slade Professorship, partly 
            in disgust, partly because of his mental depression.&quot;</font></div>

                buried in these hills: my unimprisoned soul haunts through the 
                million streets of life, living its spectral nightmare of hunger 
                and desire. Where, Ben? Where is the world?&quot;</p>

              <p>Inevitable catharsis by the threads of chaos. Unswerving punctuality 
                of chance. Apexical summation, from the billion deaths of possibility, 
                of things done. <font size="2">(Scribner softcover edition, p.
