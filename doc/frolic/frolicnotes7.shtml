            Frank’s <i>Dostoevsky: The Years of Ordeal, 1850-1859</i> (Princeton

            3, he writes: "Semites had no half-tones in their register of vision. 
            They were a people of primary colours, or rather of black and white, 
            who saw the world always in contour. They were a dogmatic people,

            knew only truth and untruth, belief and unbelief, without our hesitating
