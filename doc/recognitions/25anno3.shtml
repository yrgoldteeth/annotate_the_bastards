A serious study of anti-Catholicism in American history, Willaims's book is the source for several other sensationalist nuns' confessions mentioned in <em>R </em>: see 766.2-3, 828.44, 829.6-7.</p>

        </b>Henry de Montherlant (1896-1972), French novelist.
        Although I could not locate this exact quotation (the
        French original of Gordon's epigram) in Montherlant's
        major writings, it is possible Max is misquoting or
        paraphrasing, for there are many similar sentiments in
        Montherlant's tetralogy <i>Les Jeunes filles </i>(1936-39;
        translated into English in 1938-40 and again in 1968 - I
        shall quote from the latter: <i>The Girls, </i>trans.
        Terence Kilmartin [New York: Harper &amp; Row]). For
        example, compare the present quotation with: &quot;For
        melancholy is the luxury of the poor in spirit&quot;
        (437). (Gaddis later commented: &quot;the only other book
        of Montherlant I remember reading is Les Célibataires
        though your derivation from Les jeunes filles in another
        translation sounds likely&quot; [WG/SM].) Other possible
        borrowings from <i>The Girls</i> are Esther's complaint
        &quot;A woman is always waiting&quot; (128.21;
        Montherlant: &quot;Women are always waiting, hopefully up
        to a certain age, hopelessly thereafter&quot; [108]) and
        the orgasmic possibilities in decapitating a duck
        (76.13-14; Montherlant: &quot;How he loved to take them
        [consumptive girls] as they coughed, like those perverts
        who take ducks as they decapitate them!&quot; [536]).</font></p>

        spiritual world and an evil one the material world, which
        includes the human body. For this reason, they held

        admired the Dutch-Jewish philosopher:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Spinoza
        was educated to be a rabbi, but with increasing years he
        grew too big for Jewish theology and declined to visit
        the synagogue. It was then that some zealot tried to stab
        him. This argument being insufficient, the elders offered
        him an annual pension of a thousand florins, on condition
        that now and then he would appear in the synagogue and
        keep his opinions to himself. Spinoza was very poor, but
        his opinions were to him more precious than money. He
        refused therefore, and was excommunicated at once. The
        great ban, the Schammatha, was publicly pronounced upon
        him. For half-an-hour, to the blare of trumpets, he was
        cursed in the name which contains forty-two letters; in
        the name of Him who said, <i>I am that I am and who shall
        be</i>; in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the
        Tetragrammaton; in the name of the Globes, the Wheels,
        Mysterious Beasts and Ministering Angels; in the name of
        the great Prince Michael; in the name of Metateron, whose
        name is like that of his master; in the name of
        Achthariel Jah. The Seraphim and Ofanim were called upon
        to give mouth to the malediction. Jehovah was supplicated
        never to forgive his sin, to let all the curses in the
        Book of the Law fall upon him and blot him from under the
        heavens. Then, as the music swooned in a shudder of
        brass, the candles were reversed, and through the
        darkness the whole congregation chanted in unison, Amen!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">After
        that, Spinoza, being no longer a Jew, changed his name
        from Baruch to Benedictus, and turned his thoughts from
        the Kabbala to Descartes. </font></p>

        it was on the third day or after three days that Jesus
        was raised from the dead, was not generated by prophecy
        alone; for it was a popular belief that the spirit or
        soul of a man remains by his corpse for a period of three
        days - a belief glanced at in the legend of the raising
        of Lazarus&quot; (<i>MMM</i> 296). He continues in a note

        Isidore. The Huns, under Attila, fought in the Campagna
        against the armies of Rome. The battle was so fierce and
        prolonged that no combatants were left alive on either
        side. But the fray did not then cease, for the spirits of
        the slain proceeded to fall on one another; and for three
        days and nights a ghostly battle raged over the waste
        plain on which their bodies were stretched unburied. And
        there were those, says Damascius, who were witnesses of
        the phantom warfare, and heard the war-cries of the dead
        as they continued, with unabated fury, to rain blows upon
        one another.</font></p>
