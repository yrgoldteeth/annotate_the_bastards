        trials before you, for the priesthood: </b>an extended
        series of extracts from Phythian-Adams's <i>Mithraism </i>(83-92)
        is necessary to annotate the Mithraic elements of <i>R </i>431-32.
        (The location of Gaddis's borrowings will be indicated in
        brackets; footnotes have been eliminated.) The most
        striking feature of Mithraism, says Phythian-Adams, is
        what &quot;may be called the Tests or Trials of
        Fortitude&quot;:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Of
        these there were twelve in all [432.1] (or, as some
        writers aver, eighty!); and in the old days, in the
        mountains of the Near East, they must have been more than
        moderately severe. The Neophyte was exposed to scorching
        heat and biting cold [431.41, 43], to hunger, thirst, the
        terrors of drowning [432.2-3], to every torment (they
        were also called &quot;<i>cruciatus</i>&quot; [432.18])
        which the wit of man could devise to render the human
        body &quot;Passionless&quot; [431.8, 22], [...] to inure
        it to hardship, and strengthen it against temptation
        [431.21]. Such was the candidate's entry into the
        mysteries. [...]</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Thus
        far, then, the neophyte had learned two lessons -
        Fortitude, and Subdual of Passions [432.9-10]. His next
        lesson was Renunciation [431.37]. At some point,
        presumably as the last test had been triumphantly
        surmounted, a Crown of Victory was presented to the
        elated youth [431.26]; yet ere he could accept it, he was
        warned to thrust it from him with the words &quot;Mithras
        is my crown.&quot; So even in the moment of success, he
        learned entire submission and self dedication to his god.
        It is not surprising that Tertullian [420.15] held up
        this custom as an example and reproach to his
        &quot;Fellow soldiers in Christ.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">When
        the act of Renunciation had been made, the candidate was
        Sealed upon the forehead [432.4] and became a &quot;tried
        soldier&quot; of Mithras. It was perhaps then also that
        he was Baptized to the Remission of Sins [431.12]. Justin
        Martyr tells us that &quot;Bread and a cup of water&quot;
        [431.15] were placed with certain incantations in the
        rite of initiation. If this statement is correct, it
        describes an imperfect or preliminary act of Communion
        [431.15], which foreshadowed that fuller Participation
        which only those who had reached the grade of Lion
        [432.20] were allowed to experience.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Yet
        before the neophyte had climbed to this spiritual
        eminence, a last and greatest trial of his fortitude and
        fidelity still awaited him. [...] Now he had to Die
        [436.16, 22].</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">That
        the Mithraic mysteries (in common with all others before
        and since) contained a Mystical Death appears perhaps a
        somewhat hazardous suggestion. In reality, <i>the fact</i>
        is practically undeniable. Tertullian speaks of an
        &quot;image of Resurrection&quot; [432.33] which the
        Devil had introduced into the Mithraic rites with the
        object of overthrowing and contaminating the Truth. The
        other side of the same ritual act is fortunately
        preserved for us by the chronologist of Commodus. That
        Emperor, we are told, &quot;polluted the mysteries of
        Mithras by a real homicide, when something of the kind is
        done or spoken there to produce terror.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Interpreting
        this sentence in the light of our previous knowledge we
        obtain two facts: (1) that there was a symbolic <i>murder,
        </i>(2) that it was performed by the <i>Pater Patrum </i>[432.27],
        who was the <i>direct representative</i> of Mithras
        (since it must be presumed that Commodus would be content
        with none but the chief rôle in this as in all else).
        The mythical explanation of this act would then run as
        follows: [...] &quot;By suffering 'death' at the hands of
        the Pater Patrum, the initiate passes into true
        'life.'&quot; [...]</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">We have
        now surveyed, in however cursory a manner, the vital
        principles of the Mithraic creed. We have seen that it
        contains in &quot;outward and visible form&quot; the
        sacred &quot;Rock&quot; [431.11], Baptism, the Sign on
        the Brow, Communion of Bread and Cup [431.14-15]; and on
        its inward and spiritual side the doctrine of Sin,
        Redemption, Sacramentary Grace and Salvation to
        Everlasting Life [431.15-16]. Is it surprising that in
        the face of this astonishing similarity the Christian
        apologists denounced the Mysteries as a most crafty and
        insidious attack upon the Truth, made not, be it
        observed, by men (human plagiarism is never suggested),
        but by that great Counterfeiter, the Devil himself?</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>431.11] Born
        of the Rock: </b>Mithra was said to have been born from a
        rock, as illustrated in various Mithraic bas-reliefs
        (e.g., <i>M </i>54); see the reaction of Firmicus
        Maternus to this belief below (436.40).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>431.28] the
        third temptation, &quot;All these things will I give
        thee&quot;: </b>&quot;[...] if thou wilt fall down and
        worship me&quot; (Matt. 4:9). Similarly, Mephistopheles

        the night before), Wyatt had said, &quot;hurry . . . the

        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>431.30] he's

        sacramentum: </b>&quot;We learn from Tertullian [<i>De
        Coronâ</i>, 15] that Mithraism exacted an Oath of
        Allegiance (<i>sacramentum</i>) from the recruits for its
        'sacred warfare,' and signed or sealed them on the
        forehead as a memorial of their vow&quot; (<i>M </i>76).
        Phythian-Adams later cites Tertullian's <i>De
        Præscriptione Hæreticorum</i> (chap. 40) on the same
        point (<i>M </i>84 n.2); Rev. Gwyon's library contains
        both works.</font></p>

        and mythographer who lived in Egypt in the late fourth or
        early fifth century. (The bishop Nonnus who converted

        Abraxas [...] the resident of the highest Gnostic heaven:
        </b><i>abraxas</i> was a symbolic word used by Basilides
        of Alexandria (fl. third century) as a title for the
        divinity; later it became a proper name. There seems to
        have been seven heavens or spheres in the Gnostic system,
        though Basilides for one counted no less than 365 heavens
        - obviously reflecting the solar year (see <i>EB </i>1:62).

        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Gnosticism
        (Greek <i>gnosis, </i>knowledge) augmented Christianity
        with the speculations of Pythagoras, Plato, and other
        Greek and Oriental philosophers, which resulted in an
        esoteric &quot;religion&quot; available only to
        initiates. (Its elitism alienated many of the more
        democratic early Christians.) Emphasizing knowledge
        rather than faith, Gnosticism involved magic, occult
        symbolism, and what later would develop into alchemy.
        Several early church fathers attacked Gnosticism, the
        most thorough being Saint Irenaeus, whose <i>Against
        Heresies</i> furnishes <i>R</i>'s motto. In spite of
        Irenaeus's definitive exposé of the cult's
        contradictions and absurdities, Gnosticism continued to
        attract certain temperaments, as it does to this very
        day. </font></p>

        &quot;Mitra in Sanskrit ='Friendship' or 'Friend'&quot; (<i>M

        M[ithras]. occupied a '<i>middle</i>' place in the air
        (Vayu) between the splendour of Heaven and the gloom of
        Hell. He was thus called the Mediator (</font><font

        46), a title later transferred by Mazdaeans to his
        relations between Ormuzd and mankind. There is no trace
        of this doctrine in Mithraism, and Christian writers do
        not refer to it in spite of the obvious parallel in their
        own religion&quot; (<i>M </i>8, n.1). Cf. Weston:
        &quot;Mithra is the mediator, who stands between 'the
        inaccessible and unknowable God, who reigns in the
        ethereal spheres, and the human race which suffers here
        below'&quot; (<i>FRR</i> 165-66, quoting Cumont).</font></p>

        fact that Mithraism &quot;was a system solely and
        entirely devoted to the needs of the Male&quot; (<i>M </i>82
        and n.1). Porphry (232?-304?), Greek scholar and
        Neoplatonic philosopher, vigorously defended paganism and
        opposed Christianity in his many books. </font></p>

        harrowing of hell: </b>the apocryphal legend of the
        Harrowing of Hell (based on an enigmatic statement in 1
        Peter 3:19) has it that Jesus, on the day after his
        crucifixion (Holy Saturday), descended to hell and took
        with him to heaven the first souls to be saved. Vergil
        speaks nostalgically of the event in Dante's <i>Inferno </i>and
        names several of the lucky souls (4:52 ff.). The subject
        has been treated often in apocryphal writings (see <i>Acts
        of Pilate, </i>23.38) and religious literature (see
        epigraph to II.8 [647]). For the pagan origin of Christ's
        infernal descent, see <i>MMM </i>286.</font></p>
