        &quot;round, smooth, specially mobile atoms&quot; - and
        from Saltus (<i>AN </i>36-40), who calls Democritus
        &quot;the grandsire of materialism&quot; rather than
        &quot;sire,&quot; sees in his philosophy portents of
        atheism, and notes the philosopher's discovery &quot;that
        it is the unexpected that occurs&quot; (<i>AN </i>40). </font></p>

        Nirvana? [...] a goal where nothing was: </b>&quot;In the
        ears of not a few modern thinkers,&quot; writes Saltus of
        the Buddha's conception of Nirvana, &quot;this promise of
        annihilation has sounded like a gigantic paradox. It has
        seemed inconceivable that men could be found who would
        strive unremittingly their whole lives through to reach a
        goal where nothing was&quot; (<i>AN </i>25). </font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>497.30]
        Buddhism [...] its tangible (idolatrous) form [...] - </b><b><i>Life
        is suffering</i></b><b>: </b>with concessions in Buddhism
        to popular superstition, Saltus feels, &quot;Idolatry had
        begun [...] and today before a gilded statue a wheel of
        prayers is turned while through the dim temples, domed
        like a vase, the initiates murmur, 'Life is evil'&quot; (<i>AN
        </i>23). For Gaddis's variant &quot;<i>Life is suffering,</i>&quot;
        see 764.3.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>497.33] What

        the Gainas? They who say </b><b><i>Perhaps</i></b><b>: </b>&quot;Another
        religion without a God, and one which is a twin-sister to
        Buddhism, is that of the Gainas,&quot; writes Saltus, who
        discusses their philosophy (Jainism) over the next few
        pages (<i>AN </i>27-29). Similar to the Buddhists, they
        are more rigorous and austere in their observances, and
        like the Gnostics have an abhorrence of matter. &quot;In
        Gainism it is not existence that is an affliction,&quot;
        Saltus concludes, &quot;it is life; and the Nirväna
        [macron over a] is less an annihilation than an entrance
        into eternal beatitude. To distinguish between the two
        faiths, the Brahmans called the Buddhists, 'They who
        affirm,' and the Gainas, 'They who say, Perhaps'&quot; (<i>AN
        </i>29). </font></p>

        chain of twenty-four lakhs [...] might be severed: </b>in
        an effort to explain the existence of pain, writes
        Saltus, &quot;the Hindu accepted an unfathered idea that
        he is expiating the sins of anterior and unremembered
        existences, and that he will continue to expiate them
        until all past transgressions are absolved and the soul
        is released from the chain of its migrations. According
        to the popular theory, the chain of migrations consists
        in twenty-four lakhs of birth, a lakh being one hundred
        thousand&quot; (<i>AN </i>11); and later: &quot;while the
        Buddha agreed with the Brahmans that life formed a chain
        of existences, it was the former who brought the hope
        that the chain might be severed&quot; (<i>AN </i>21). </font></p>

        pronounced for fear of its falling into enemy hands and
        being used against him in sorcery, and as a result the
        original pronunciation is now unknown. In addition,
        12-letter, 42-letter, and 72-letter names of Yahweh were
        known to initiates. (Some of these appear in Waite's <i>Book
