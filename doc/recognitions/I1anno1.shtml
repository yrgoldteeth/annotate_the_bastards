        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Among the Aztecs of South

            at their feet. At the end of every period of fifty-two years, in the month 
            of November when the Pleiades would culminate at midnight, these rude 
            people imagined the world would end. Human sacrifices were offered, while

            celebrated the reconstruction of the world. Although Druidism is now extinct 
            the relics of it remain to this day, for in our calendar we still find 
            Nov. 1st marked as &quot;All Saints' Day,&quot; and in the pre-Reformation 
            calendar the last day of October was marked &quot;All Hallow Eve,&quot;

        (On Gaddis's name for the monastery, critic Rodger Cunningham comments: 
        &quot;Gaddis seems to think that <i>otra vez</i> means the same as the 
        French <i>autrefois,</i> which it doesn't. Gaddis's Spanish, evidently 
        learned orally, is frequently ungrammatical and Frenchified&quot; [letter 
        to me, 25 January 1991].)</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">The Curé d'Ars, St. Jean 
            Vianney [1786-1859], was sensibly persecuted by devils. At night the infernal 
            enemy would rouse him from his few hours' sleep by thundering blows upon 
            the doors and walls of the presbytery. [...] An awful silence followed 
            for a few moments, and there were heard yells of maddened laughter which 
            froze the very blood of the listeners. [...] This persecution of the demon 
            - the <i>grappin</i> as St. Jean Vianney called him - continued for a 
            period of no less than 30 years, and the phenomena are attested by dozens 
            of impeccable witnesses. Thus the infernal enemy would drum incessantly 
            upon the table or chimney-piece, would imitate the clearing of wood, planing 
            boards, hammering nails, just as if a carpenter were noisily at work in 
            the house; would overthrow platters and smash a water-jug to smithereens. 
            M. Monnin, who was actually present, relates how one night the evil one 
            set fire to the heavy serge curtains of the Saint's bed. &quot;Ah, this 
            is a good sign,&quot; mildly observed the Curé, &quot;the demon is very 
            angry with us.&quot;</font></p>

        the world, before accident: </b>as Koenig points out (&quot;'Splinters,'&quot; 
        77), this is from Lang's <i>Magic and Religion </i>(85):<i> </i>&quot;Early 
        men, contrary to Mr. Frazer's account, suppose themselves to be <i>naturally</i> 
        immortal. The myths of perhaps all races tell of a time when death had 
        not yet entered the world. Man was born deathless. Death came in by an 
        accident, or in consequence of an error, or an infraction of a divine

        of religion thus: &quot;But as men advanced from almost the lowest savagery, 
        they gradually attained to higher material culture, developing the hitherto 
        unknown arts of agriculture, developing also religion, in the despair 
        of magic, developing gods, and evolving social and political rank, with 
        kings at the head of society. [...] But though it was in the despair of 
        magic that men invented gods and religion, yet, as men will, they continue 
        to exercise the magic of which they despaired&quot; (</font><a

        face="New York,Times New Roman"><i>M&amp;R</i></font></a><font
        face="New York,Times New Roman"> 83). Lang, however, disagrees and cautions: 
        &quot;This question cannot be historically determined. If we find a race 
        which has magic but no religion, we cannot be certain that it did not 
        once possess a religion of which it has despaired&quot; (<i>M&amp;R</i>
