        from the concluding paragraph of &quot;Extreme
        Unction&quot; in <i>EB</i>: &quot;It was a popular
        opinion in the middle ages that extreme unction
        extinguishes all ties and links with this world, so that
        he who has received it must, if he recovers, renounce the
        eating of flesh and matrimonial relations. Such opinions,
        combated by bishops and councils, were due to the
        influence of the <i>consolamentum</i> of the
        Cathars&quot; (9:3; see 532.5 for Catharism).</font></p>

        George Borrow [...] the most vivid interview with
        desolation: </b>(1803-81), English traveler, philologist,
        and writer, best known for his autobiographical novels on
        Gypsy life (<i>Lavengro, The Romany Rye</i>). He was an
        agent for the Bible Society in Spain and Russia, and his
        experiences in the former are recounted in <i>The Bible
        in Spain </i>(1843), to which the present allusion
        refers. En route from Portugal to Spain, Borrow comes
        upon a madman among some ruins and comments: &quot;But
        the maniac, on his stone, in the rear of the wind-beaten
        ruin overlooking the blasted heath, above which scowled
        the leaden heaven, presented such a picture of gloom and
        misery as I believe neither painter nor poet ever
        conceived in the saddest of their musings&quot; (66).
        Gaddis &quot;mentioned Borrow once to Robt Graves who
        dismissed him as 'the biggest liar who ever lived'&quot;
        (WG/SM.)</font></p>

        minor English poet Thomas Flatman (1637-88) was surprised
        that a monarch simply dies as any commoner would, and he
        wrote the quoted line, cited in a footnote in De
