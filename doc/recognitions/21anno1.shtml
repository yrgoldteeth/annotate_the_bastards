    Quincey: </b>(1785-1859), English essayist and opium addict. The epigraph is from his
    famous <i>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i> (1821; rev. ed. 1856), part 3:
    &quot;The Pains of Opium.&quot; The quotation is from the middle of a sentence that
    begins: &quot;Of this, at least, I feel assured, that there is no such thing as ultimate <i>forgetting</i>;
    traces once impressed upon the memory are indestructible; a thousand accidents
    [...].&quot; The passage is a Proustian discussion of involuntary memory, of experiences
    apparently forgotten but suddenly &quot;<i>recognized</i>&quot; in new circumstances (De
    Quincey's italics).</font></p>
    <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>282.17] metaphysical (Bergsonian) hilarity: </b>though
    best known for his philosophical investigations into the nature of time, the French
    philosopher Henri Bergson (1859-1941) also wrote an important essay entitled
    &quot;Laughter,&quot; which has been translated into English and published in many
    anthologies.</font></p>

    [nineteenth-century] arguments used by the clergy against anesthesia varied,&quot; Dr.
    Haggard notes, &quot;but all centered around the theme that pain, particularly the pain of
    childbirth, was the ordained lot of mankind; to prevent it was a sacrilege. As one
    clergyman expressed it, 'chloroform is a decoy of Satan, apparently offering itself to
    bless women; but in the end it will harden society and rob God of the deep, earnest cries
    which arise in time of trouble for help'&quot; (<i>DDD</i> 108).</font></p>
    <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>289.13] smallpox a visitation of God: </b>in
    his &quot;Answers to the Religious Objection Against the Employment of Anesthetic Agents
    in Midwifery and Surgery&quot; (1847), Dr. James Y. Simpson &quot;explains that
    opposition, particularly on theological grounds, had been presented against every humane
    innovation in the past. He cites as an instance the opposition to the introduction of
    vaccination against smallpox. Those opposed to its introduction had argued against it on
    religious grounds. 'Smallpox,' they had said, 'is a visitation from God, and originates in
    man: but the cowpox [vaccination] is produced by presumptuous, impious man. The former
    Heaven ordained; the latter is a daring and profane violation of our holy religion'&quot;
    (<i>DDD </i>109). </font></p>

    grave&quot;: </b>from Robert Louis Stevenson's short story &quot;Olalla&quot; (1885),
    concerning the deterioration of a Spanish Catholic family. At the end of the family line
    is a saintly girl named Olalla, who in the quoted passage (as well as in the quotation on
    p. 302 below) rejects the narrator's marriage proposal in order to allow her ruined family
    to die out. The story is usually found in collections of Stevenson's supernatural fiction
    (as is &quot;Thrawn Janet,&quot; which Gaddis alludes to elsewhere).</font></p>

    the great Spanish mystics of the sixteenth century,&quot; de Rougemont writes (<i>LWW</i>
    133-34), &quot;Saint Teresa and Saint John of the Cross, we find them employing the whole
    rhetoric of courtly love, even its most delicate shades of expression. Here are the chief
    topics common alike to the troubadours and these orthodox mystics:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">&quot;To die of not being able to
    die.&quot; [cf. 40.7]<br>
    The &quot;sweet cautery.&quot;<br>
    &quot;Love's dart&quot; that wounds but does not kill. [...]<br>
    To complain of an ill that is yet prized more than every joy and worldly good. [...]<br>
    The &quot;stolen heart,&quot; the &quot;ravished understanding,&quot; the &quot;rape of
    love.&quot;<br>
    Love treated as an ultimate &quot;understanding&quot; (<i>conoscenza</i> in Provençal).</font></p>
    <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>300.41] Gerbert, Archbishop of Ravenna: </b>citing
    Michelet's <i>Histoire de France, </i>Saltus writes (<i>AN </i>90):</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">According to the gossip of the day,
    Gerbert, once a Spanish student, afterwards Archbishop of Ravenna, and subsequently Pope
    [as Sylvester II, 999-1003], entered into an agreement of this kind, and one night the
    devil came in person to claim him. It was an agreement they had made together long before
    in Cordova, where Gerbert, finding his studies too arduous, had signed the bond in
    exchange for the royal road. It was the devil who had taught him all he knew - algebra,
    clock-making, and how to become a Pope. It was clear as day that he would have known none
    of these things without infernal assistance. Gerbert resists, but Mephisto proves his
    claim. &quot;You did not think me a logician, did you?&quot; are said to have been his
    historic words, and, presto! Gerbert disappeared in a fork of lambent flame.</font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>301.2] SS Elizabeth Matilda 
        Bridget [...] drops of blood 3,000,800): </b>from the ever-sardonic Marsh 
        (<i>MMSM </i>145-47):</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">We do not know the original 
        date of the two miraculous documents we next describe. Judging from internal 
        evidence, we should presume them to be of quite modern fabrication, and 
        of Jesuit paternity. [...] The first lays claim to some antiquity, having 
        been found, it is said, in the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, and afterward 
        preserved in a silver casket by the Emperor Charles V. and &quot;His Holiness.&quot; 
        The story is that Christ appeared to St. Elizabeth, St. Matilda, and St. 
        Bridget, and delivered to them a written account of the details of his 
        passion, stating the number of soldiers who attended the Crucifixion; 
        of kicks, blows, and wounds inflicted upon the Saviour by them; of punctures 
        from the crown of thorns; and of drops of blood shed and sighs breathed 
        by the sufferer. The fractures of the skull, it is said, were one hundred 
        in number, and the drops of blood thirty-eight thousand four hundred and 
        thirty. [...]</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The other miraculous communication is a
    letter from the Saviour, printed in characters of gold, and sent, through her guardian
    angel, to a girl of St. Marcel, in France. It was published at Rome &quot;by permission of
    His Holiness, Pius IX.&quot; It resembles the first, of which it appears to be a French
    amplification, the numbers having been multiplied in some such proportion as the dignity
    of a pope bears to that of an archbishop; for the drops of blood are reckoned at three
    millions and eight hundred. [...] These disgusting and profane fables are printed by
    hundreds of thousands, and exposed for sale, together with vulgar and often immoral
    ballads, at half the street-corners and bookstalls in Florence, Rome, and other Italian
    towns.</font></p>

    <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>301.12] Sir William Rowan Hamilton: </b>&quot;The
    Irish mathematician, Sir William Rowan Hamilton [1805-65], once allowed himself to be
    drawn into the speculation of how far out into space Jesus could proceed in a certain time
    if he was rising at the moderate rate which the above passage [Acts 1:9] contemplates.
    When his calculations revealed to him that he would as yet not have reached the nearest of
    the fixed stars, he began, as a good Christian, to recoil from his speculations, and
    relegated the matter to faith, as a mystery beyond the reach of human reason&quot; (<i>MMM
    </i>358-59).</font></p>

    <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>302.9] Saint Nicolas of Tolentino:</b> from
    Summers (<i>PPM </i>68):</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The Augustinian mystic, St. Nicholas of
    Tolentino, as he lay wasted and weak on his death-bed, exhausted by the broiling August
    heat, so excited the pity of his sorrowing brethren that they brought him a dish of doves,
    most delicately dressed, to tempt his appetite. The Saint, however, reproved them, firmly,
    but in gentle terms. He had never tasted animal food in his life. Painfully raising
    himself on his poor pallet, he stretched his hands over the dish, and lo! the birds
    rejoicing were in a flash covered with plumage, and flew out of the window of his little
    white-washed cell towards the blue sky beyond. But they hovered around until in a few days
    the Saint breathed his last [10 September 1306], when they were seen mounting into the
    air, accompanying (as it is piously believed) his soul to Paradise. For as he breathed his
    last the room was filled with a heavenly fragrance, as of lilies, and gleamed with radiant
    light.</font></p>
    <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>302.21] &quot;You are a man [...] and are
    warned and pity . . .&quot;: </b>from Stevenson's &quot;Olalla&quot;; see 298.12.</font></p>
    <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>303.16] Oedipus and all the rest: </b>the
    search for a physical or spiritual father is a theme running throughout world literature,
    from Sophocles' Oedipus to Clement in <i>The Recognitions </i>to Hamlet to Stephen
    Dedalus, and now to Otto Pivner.</font></p>
    <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>303.21] Vesey Street: </b>in lower Manhattan,

    <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>304.38] These are the moments [...] with its
    spirit unbroken: </b>from Mansfield's review in the <i>Athenæum </i>(10 September 1920)
    of E. V. Lucas's <i>Verena in the Midst, </i>an epistolary novel about a woman confined to
    her bed, comforted with letters from a variety of characters. The first paragraph of the
    review - reprinted in Mansfield's <i>Novels and Novelists, </i>ed. J. Middleton Murray
    (1930), the book Esther shared with Otto on pp. 124-25 - reads:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">It is a fearful thing to have to lie in
    bed. To be sent to bed, to be commanded to stay there - to gaze from a little valley of
    humiliation, up, up to that ineffable brow that, wreathed with the mists of discretion and
    vacancy bends over one. . . . To pipe: &quot;When shall I be allowed to get up
    again?&quot; and to be answered by: &quot;We had rather postpone our answer for the
    present.&quot; These are moments which set the soul yearning to be taken suddenly,
    snatched out of the very heart of some fearful joy, and set before its Maker, hatless,
    dishevelled and gay, with its spirit unbroken. For it is impossible to go condemned to bed
    in our grown-uppishness without recalling how favourite a remedy it was with our parents
    and nurses for a spirit that wanted breaking. There, naked between the sheets, prone when
    all the rest of the world is walking or leaping, conscious, to a hopeless degree, that it
    certainly isn't for you that the clocks chime, the cups rattle, the lamps are lighted and
    the door-bell rings, one wages many a fierce battle. But the infants who emerge triumphant
    are, depend upon it, bound to be attacked by larger nurses and more unyielding parents
    later on, who will send them back to bed for another tussle, as though it were never too
    late to break. . . .</font></p>

    the Viareggio I simply took the next town up or down the coast [of Italy]&quot; (WG/SM).</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Meanwhile, the popes and princes of the
    Church had lost faith, and decency as well. Petrarch, in his letters <i>Sine titulo, </i>speaks
    of the papal court as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">&quot;There is here (in Avignon)
    everything imaginable in the way of confusion, darkness and horror. Avignon is the sewer
    of every vice, the gully of every wickedness. I know from personal experience that in this
    place there is neither piety nor charity. Faith is absent; there is nothing holy, nothing
    just, nothing human. Friendship, modesty and decency are unknown. Houses, squares,
    temples, courts and pontifical palaces drip with lies. The hope of a future life is
    considered an illusion; Jesus Christ is looked upon as a useless invention; virtue is
    regarded as a proof of stupidity, and prostitution leads to fame.&quot; </font></p>

    is not Hemingway but a character who takes advantage of his physical resemblance to the
    writer. On the other hand, Hemingway was in New York in November 1949, and his pugnacious,
    boorish behavior was the subject of a devastating profile by Lillian Ross in the <i>New
    Yorker </i>(13 May 1950), which Gaddis probably read. A copy of <i>R</i> was in
    Hemingway's library at the Finca Vigía in Cuba, no doubt a complimentary copy sent by
    Gaddis and/or his publisher; whether Hemingway actually read it or not is unknown; see
    James D. Brasch and Joseph Sigman's <i>Hemingway's Library: A Composite Record </i>(New
    York: Garland, 1981), 136 (item 2399).</font></p>
