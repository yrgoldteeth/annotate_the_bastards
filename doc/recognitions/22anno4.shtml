        Dictionary</i>: &quot;'The word translated [in the Old
        Testament] firmament is the Hebrew word <i>rakia. </i>[...]
        A secondary purpose of the <i>rakia</i> was to support
        the heavenly bodies - sun, moon, and stars - in which
        they were fixed as nails, and from which, consequently,
        they might be said to drop off'&quot; (<i>AMM</i> 28). </font></p>

        concerning the Pleiades relates that they were so

        them, much to their discomfiture. They appealed to
        Jupiter for assistance and he pitying them changed them
        into doves. Thereupon they flew into the sky and found a
        refuge among the stars&quot; (<i>SL </i>419).</font></p>

        cliff that Alexander climbed in India: </b>Lethaby (<i>AMM
        </i>112-13) thus summarizes a portion of the medieval <i>Romance
        of Alexander </i>by Pseudo-Callisthenes: </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">In
        India, Alexander and his army came to two paths, eastward
        and north; they try eastward, but it is impassable, and
        they go back and attempt the other to the north, by which
        at last they reach a cliff covered with diamonds, with
        hanging chains of red gold. Two thousand five hundred
        steps there were, which they ascend, and reach the clouds
        and &quot;wait for wonders.&quot; They see &quot;a
        palais, one of the precioussest and proudest in earth,
        and built, as the book says, with two broad gates and
        seventy windows, of gold, carven, and clustered with
        gems.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">There
        was a temple surrounded by a garden of golden vines full
        of great fruit of carbuncle stones; it was the
        &quot;house of the sun&quot; and paradise. Alexander
        enters, and on a gorgeous bed he finds a god, who asks
        him if he would have his future known by inquiry of the
        trees of the sun and moon; on his consenting, they
        approach two enormous trees, that of the moon was silver;
        the tree of the sun was gold, and on its crest sat
        &quot;a proud bird.&quot; &quot;All gilded was her gorge
        with golden feathers.&quot; &quot;Yon is a fearless fowl,
        a Fenix we call.&quot; It is predicted that Alexander
        will never return.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>387.34] Sir
        John Mandeville [...] </b><b><i>Travels</i></b><b>: </b>purporting
        to be a travel guide to the Holy Lands and the Orient,
        this popular medieval book is actually a collection of
        imaginative legends and superstitions. Although the
        author claims to be an Englishman from Saint Albans,
        &quot;Sir John Mandeville&quot; was a physician of Liège
        named Jehan de Bourgogne who wrote the book in 1356-57.
        The English version is a translation from the French made
        sometime before 1500. Combining a vivid imagination with
        genuine travel accounts, the author collected many of the
        legends of Prester John (see 408.14 ff.). The quoted
        remark about Paradise is from chap. 33, as quoted by
        Lethaby (<i>AMM </i>113, immediately following the
        Alexander episode quoted above). </font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>388.3]
        Through the world of night [...] corridors dark and
        dangerous: </b>a condensation of an extract from Gaston
        Maspero's <i>Egyptian Archaeology </i>(1887), as quoted
        by Lethaby (<i>AMM </i>169-70):</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">&quot;During
        the day the pure soul was in no serious danger, but in
        the evening, when the eternal waters which flow along the
        vaulted heavens fall in vast cascades adown the west and
        are engulphed in the bowels of the earth, the soul
        follows the escort of the sun and the other luminary gods
        into the lower world bristling with ambuscades and
        perils. For twelve hours the divine squadron defiles
        through long and gloomy corridors, where numerous genii,
        some hostile, some friendly, now struggle to bar the way,
        and now to aid it in surmounting the difficulties of the
        journey. Great doors, each guarded by a gigantic serpent,
        were stationed at intervals, and led to an immense hall
        full of flame and fire, peopled by hideous monsters and
        executioners, whose office it was to torture the damned.
        Then came more dark and narrow passages, more blind
        gropings in the gloom, more strife with malevolent genii,
        and again the welcoming of the propitious gods. At
        midnight began the upward journey towards the eastern
        region of the world; and in the morning, having reached
        the confines of the Land of Darkness, the sun emerged
        from the east to light another day.&quot; &quot;The tombs
        of the kings were constructed upon the model of the world
        of night. They had their passages, their doors, their
        vaulted halls, which plunged down into the depths of the
        mountain.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>388.3] lost
        souls clutching their guidebooks: </b>&quot;the
        guide-book for the dead was laid in the coffin, telling
        them of all the turnings, and of all the <i>ruses</i> of
        the wicked spirits who would entice them away from the
        one true path&quot; (<i>AMM </i>172). Earlier (157)
        Lethaby identified the guidebook as the <i>Book of the
        Dead </i>(see 49.13). </font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>388.5] so the
        king built his tomb deep in earth [...] So Egypt: </b>&quot;The
        Tomb of Seti I. penetrates 470 feet and is 180 feet deep
        in the earth; another has some 24,000 square feet taken
        up by the passages, halls, staircases, pits, and chambers
        of the tomb&quot; (<i>AMM </i>171).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>388.9] Red in

        53.14.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>388.15] sun
        and the moon [...] through a subterranean passage: </b>&quot;The
        general early view, however, was that there were two
        openings - the Gates of the East, and the Gates of the
        West. Through the one the sun enters in the morning the
        mundane temple, to pass out at the other in the evening,
        and thence pursue its way back by the dark path of the
        under world&quot; (<i>AMM </i>174).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>388.19]
        Raging up and down the sky [...] exit only at opposite
        ends: </b>&quot;In the Talmud an exactly similar account
        [to that of the Persian <i>Bundahish</i>] is given. The
        sun rages up and down the eastern and western horizon
        like a mighty beast prisoned in a cage; it cannot go
        farther because of the enclosing sides of the firmament.
        The gates for it to pass to the lower world and rise
        again are only found in the ends of the box&quot; (<i>AMM
        </i>66-67).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>388.25] Down:
        down went Tammuz (slain by the boar's tusk) [...] to the
        lower world: </b>&quot;In Babylon also it was at the
        world's centre that Tammuz made his descent, for here is
        the lid stone of the lower world&quot; (<i>AMM </i>78).
        The parenthetical remark is from <i>AMM </i>160-61:
        &quot;'One of the most popular of old Babylonian myths,'
        says Professor Sayce, 'told how Istar had wedded the
        young and beautiful sun-god Tammuz, and had descended
        into Hades in search of him when he had been slain by the
        boar's tusk of winter.'&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>388.33] the
        Piute Indians followed the sun [...] distended with
        stars: </b>also from Lethaby (<i>AMM </i>165):</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Mr
        A[ndrew] Lang quotes, in his &quot;Myth and Ritual,&quot;
        an account given by the Piute Indians: &quot;Down, deep
        under the ground, deep, deep, under all the ground, is a
        great hole. At night, when he has passed over the world,
        looking down on everything, and finished his work, he,
        the sun, goes into his hole, and he crawls and creeps
        along it till he comes to his bed in the middle part of
        the earth. So then he, the sun, stops there in his bed
        all night. This hole is so little, and he, the sun, is so
        big, that he cannot turn round in it; and so he must,
        when he has had all his sleep, pass on through, and in
        the morning we see him come out in the east. When he, the
        sun, has so come out, he begins to hunt up through the
        sky to catch and eat any he can of the stars, his
        children, for if he does not so catch and eat he cannot
        live. He, the sun, is not all seen. The shape of him is
        like a snake or lizard. It is not his head that we can
        see, but his belly, filled up with the stars that times
        and times he has swallowed.&quot; </font></p>

        reconstruction of what the morning ritual of sunrise

        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">It is
        the moment of sunrise, chill and expectant; all the gates
        are thrown open to the east. The worshippers are waiting,
        and the golden tips of the obelisks are already burning.
        The sun shows its red rim through the open ceremonial
        gate of the outer court. They prostrate themselves.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">There
        is a sudden awaking sense of heat and life and light, a
        passing vibration in the air. The little bells festooned
        from pillar to pillar shiver out silver notes; a deep
        strain vibrates from the sanctuary. They stand on their
        feet. The great gates of the temple close with a clangour
        that reverberates like thunder.</font></p>
