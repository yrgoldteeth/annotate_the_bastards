        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>545.27] Boyg:
        </b>Gaddis provided the following gloss for his Italian
        translator (quoted in Koenig's &quot;'Splinters from the
        Yew Tree,'&quot; 92):</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">p. 545
        l.27 the &quot;Boyg&quot; was the troll king in Ibsen's
        &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; who wanted Peer to marry his ugly
        troll daughter and, in order to cure Peer of his
        'pestilent nature' and make him see as trolls do, says he
        will scratch his eyes so that Peer will &quot;see awry;
        but all that you see will seem fair and brave.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The
        reference is to Brown, as elaborated on page 375 lines
        15-19, Brown as the Boyg-troll king having perverted
        Wyatt's vision so that the false looks beautiful.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">However, the
        Boyg and the troll king are not the same; the former is a
        mysterious voice in the darkness, an insubstantial
        substance, that advises Peer to go around rather than
        through it. (In act 4 Peer sees a resemblance between the
        Boyg and the Egyptian sphinx.) The translators of the
        edition Gaddis used interpret the Boyg chiefly &quot;as
        the Spirit of Compromise among other things.&quot;</font></p>

        &quot;The Romance of Llew Llaw Gyffes,&quot; a story from
        the Welsh collection of legends <i>The Mabinogion, </i>in
        Lady Charlotte Guest's translation as quoted by Graves (<i>WG
        </i>251-58). In a kind of virgin birth, a young boy is
        born to Arianrhod, who later denies any kinship and
        refuses to name him. But when the boy (like Wyatt)
        skillfully kills a wren, she says: &quot;Verily, with a
        steady hand did the lion aim at it.&quot; Thereafter, the
        boy is called &quot;Llew Llaw Gyffes&quot; - the Lion
        with the Steady Hand. </font></p>

        &quot;how constant and unvarying in character continued
        to be the expectations and aspirations of this
        downtrodden race&quot; (<i>MMM </i>363-66). Forced to
        choose between death or Islam, he &quot;chose the latter;
        and Felure [Conybeare's source] testifies to the despair
        with which the apostasy of their Messiah filled the Jews

        (more commonly known as <i>The Golden Ass</i>) concerns a
        young man named Lucius who is accidentally turned into an

        One radiant form, a woman sweet and fair;<br>

        Dare I believe the fires of love returning?<br>

        Has this dear angel come my soul to save?</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">This opens the
        duet that closes the second act. The opera ends as Senta
        (in the words of the libretto) &quot;throws herself into
        the sea. Immediately the Dutchman's ship disappears in
        the waves. In the red light of the rising sun, the
        glorified forms of Senta and the Dutchman are seen, in a
        close embrace, rising from the wreck of the vessel, and
        soaring upwards.&quot;</font></p>

        Mithraism, though it numbered countless adherents, though
        it boasted generals, governors, and emperors among the
        faithful, was helpless before the ordered onset of the

        that God might have been able to make possible a square
        circle or a mountain without a valley - our knowledge of
        these truths no longer derives its certainty from
