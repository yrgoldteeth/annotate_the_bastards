        suggests is a reference to &quot;Celestine V, who became
        Pope in 1294. He was a man of saintly life, but allowed
        himself to be convinced by a priest named Benedetto that
        his soul was in danger since no man could live in the
        world without being damned. In fear for his soul he
        withdrew from all worldly affairs and renounced the
        papacy. [...] Celestine's great guilt is that his

        Jean Paulhan's <i>Les fleurs de Tarbes </i>(1941);
        Maurice Blanchot's review of this critical work led to an
        important debate in France on the status of literature. J

        selfish craving); (3) Desire can be eliminated; (4), it
