        interdict was later extended to all places that might
        give Huss shelter. (The Town Carpenter was first
        associated with Wenceslaus by Wyatt at 37.12, and will be

        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">About
        1165, a letter was circulated purporting to be addressed
        by Prester John to the [Byzantine] emperor Manuel. This
        letter, professing to come from &quot;Presbyter Joannes,
        by the power and virtue of God and of the Lord Jesus
        Christ, Lord of Lords,&quot; claimed that he was the
        greatest monarch under heaven, as well as a devout
        Christian. The letter dealt at length with the wonders of
        his empire. It was his desire to visit the Holy Sepulchre
        with a great host, and to subdue the enemies of the
        Cross. Seventy-two kings, reigning over as many kingdoms,
        were his tributaries. His empire extended over the three
        Indies, including that Farther India where lay the body
        of St. Thomas, to the sun-rising, and back again down the
        slope to the ruins of Babylon and the tower of Babel. In
        war thirteen great crosses made of gold and jewels were
        carried in wagons before him as his standards, and each
        was followed by 10,000 knights and 100,000 footmen. There
        were no poor in his dominions, no thief or robber, no
        flatterer or miser, no dissensions, no lies, and no
        vices. His palace was built after the plan of that which
        St. Thomas erected for the Indian king Gondopharus.
        Before it was a marvellous mirror erected on a
        many-storeyed pedestal; in this speculum he could discern
        everything that went on throughout his dominions, and
        detect conspiracies. He was waited on by 7 kings at a
        time, by 60 dukes and 365 counts; 12 archbishops sat on
        his right hand, and 20 bishops on his left, besides the
        patriarch of St. Thomas's the protopope of the
        Sarmagantians (Samarcand?), and the archprotopope of
        Susa, where the royal residence was. Should it be asked
        why, with all this power and splendour, he calls himself
        merely &quot;presbyter,&quot; this is because of his
        humility, and because it was not fitting for one whose
        chamberlain was a bishop and king, and whose chief cook
        was an abbot and king, to be called by such titles as
        these.</font></p>
