        his fame. They exchanged a dozen or so letters over a

        intrigued but cautious: &quot;I kept saying to myself all

        a simple joker?&quot; - therefore: &quot;I mask myself
        among masked people. It is straight fighting&quot;

        Letters of Guy de Maupassant and Marie Bashkirtseff</i>
        [London: Rodale, 1954], 40). In his final letter

        whether Proust did indeed do as Herschel suggests, not so
        much with Odette as with Albertine later in the novel.
