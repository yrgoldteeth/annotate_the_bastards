        &quot;There was something terribly lacking between what I
        felt and what I could do&quot;: </b>from an exchange
        between Fedya and Prince Sergius (1.4), which reveals
        many similarities between Fedya and Wyatt:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">PRINCE
            SERGIUS (<i>after a pause</i>):
            I must confess that you bewilder me. You with your gifts
            and charm and really au fond - a wonderful sense of
            what's right. How could you have permitted yourself to
            plunge into such tawdry distractions? How could you have
            forgotten so far what you owed to yourself? Tell me, why
            did you let your life fall into this ruin?</font></p>
          <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">FEDYA (<i>suppressing
            emotion</i>): . . . Ah, yes, my ruin. Well, first, drink,
            not because it tasted well, because everything I did
            disappointed me so, made me so ashamed of myself. I feel
            ashamed now, while I talk to you. Whenever I drank, shame
            was drowned in the first glass, and sadness. Then music,
            not opera or Beethoven, buy gypsy music; the passion of
            it poured energy into my body, while those dark
            bewitching eyes looked into the bottom of my soul. (<i>He
            sighs</i>) And the more alluring it all was, the more
            shame I felt afterwards. </font></p>
          <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">PRINCE
            SERGIUS (<i>after a pause</i>):
            But what about your career?</font></p>
          <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">FEDYA: My career?
            This seems to be it. Once I was a director of a bank.
            There was something terribly lacking between what I felt
            and what I could do. (<i>Abruptly</i>) But enough, enough
            of myself. It makes me rather nervous to think about
            myself.</font></p>
