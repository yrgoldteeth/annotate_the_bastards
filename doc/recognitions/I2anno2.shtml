        <p><strong>69.12] resurrection:</strong> Gaddis's blasphemous&nbsp;use of &quot;resurrection&quot; for an erection may have been inspired by Boccaccio; in his essay &quot;Old Foes with New Faces,&quot; Gaddis cites a tale from the <em>Decameron</em> (day 3, story 10) in which a naive girl, seduced by a monk, &quot;marvels at the unfamiliar resurrection of the flesh thrusting forth&quot; (RSP 102). There is a passing reference to Boccaccio later in&nbsp;R (858.17). </p>

          became of the man who was raised?): </b>upon being raised
          from the dead (John 11:44), Lazarus is regarded by the
          Jewish chief priests as a contributing factor in Jesus'
          popularity and consequently they decide to do away with
          him (12:10-11). Whether this was carried out is left
          unsaid. Huizinga comments: &quot;Nothing betrays more
          clearly the excessive fear of death felt in the Middle
          Ages than the popular belief, then widely spread,
          according to which Lazarus, after his resurrection, lived
          in a continual misery and horror at the thought that he
          should have again to pass through the gate of death&quot; (<i>WMA </i>131-32).</font></p>

        of Conway's study concerns him). Rogier de la Pasture Flemicized his name

      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>71.34] I could guarantee you 
        excellent reviews: </b>a similar offer was made to Han Van Meegeren (1889-1947), 
        a forger much in the news when <i>R </i>was being written, and whose career 
        Gaddis used as a model for Wyatt's. Frustrated at the critical neglect 
        of his own work, Van Meegeren over a period of ten years in the 1930s 
        and 1940s forged several Vermeers (supposedly dating from a gap in Vermeer's 
        life) that completely fooled the critics and were sold at prices befitting 
        rediscovered old masters. When for political reasons Van Meegeren finally 
        confessed, the red-faced critics denied he had the talent to forge such 
        works; materials were brought to his prison cell, and there he forged 
        another for the benefit of these critics. Van Meegeren died in jail shortly 
        thereafter. Both his technical accomplishments - especially reproducing 
        chemically the aging process a seventeenth-century painting would have 
        undergone - and his &quot;spiritual&quot; identification with Vermeer 
        were adapted by Gaddis as components in Wyatt's approach to his own forgeries. 
        For a fuller discussion, see Tom Sawyer's &quot;False Gold to Forge: The 
        Forger behind Wyatt Gwyon,&quot; <i>Review of Contemporary Fiction </i>2.2 
        (Summer 1982): 50-54.</font></p>

        French apartment houses, lights on each landing were turned on as you 
        reached it; it would stay on for one minute only and then go out. It was 
        an electricity-saving device, giving light for long enough to get out 
        your keys or move up to the next landing.. Americans living in Paris in 
        the time of Gaddis were charmed by the device and it was a frequent subject 
        in conversations. Cremer reaches the floor, turns on the minuiterie, and 
        is suddenly illuminated. But in a minute he will be in the dark again.

        having kept him for the space of seven years in this
        abject state of slavery, he caused his eyes to be put
        out, though he was then eighty-three years of age. This
        not satiating his desire of revenge, he soon after
        ordered his body to be flayed alive, and rubbed with
        salt, under which torments he expired [A.D. 267]; and
        thus fell one of the most tyrannical emperors of Rome,
        and one of the greatest persecutors of the Christians.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Wyatt associates
        Valerian with his father (405.6-10, 421.18); Brown later
        acquires this painting - thinking it genuine (231.32) -
        from which Wyatt will cut out the figure of Valerian when
        he leaves for Spain; Valerian is later associated by Ludy
        (and perhaps by Wyatt as well) with the porter at the
        Real Monasterio (896.1 ff.). The description of Wyatt's
        Memling closely matches David's painting (see 70.37),
        even to the red cloak in the foreground. </font></p>

        affirm that the brutal dogma of equality is a lie; I
        denounce it as a danger. . . . It has given birth to the
        insane theory according to which all offices ought to be
        open to all, and that all have the right to participate
        in the government of the commonwealth. . . . It is not
        true that the direction of the commonwealth, the exercise
        of authority, is not the lawful privilege, the hereditary
        prerogative, of certain classes. . . . After the civil
        constitution of the clergy, the greatest crime of the
        Revolution was the abolition of the corporations
        [trade-guilds which had the exclusive right of exercising
        their callings, according to their own regulations]. . .
        . The day will come when the vile horde of revolutionists
        . . . will be reduced to utter the imprecation of the
        apostate, 'Galilæan, thou hast conquered.' Ah, for them
        no mercy; they are not the people, they are hell
