        on his knees, his eyes streaming with tears, when he
        painted Christ on the Cross, and we can well believe it.

        curious to hear the various opinions entertained by
        collectors and art lovers concerning faking and its
        alarming and increasing success,&quot; Nobili writes.
        &quot;An old collector who had, no doubt like so many of
        his colleagues, learned his lesson through being duped,
        unhesitatingly declared that faking is a grand art with a
        reason for existence as it seems to meet a real need of
        society, the need of being, as it were, deluded and
        cheated by elegance. Queer ethics answering to the Latin
        saying: <i>Vulgus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur</i> (The
        crowd likes to be deceived, let it be deceived!)&quot; (<i>GAF</i>

        face="New York,Times New Roman">B.C</font><font
        face="New York,Times New Roman">.], and of whom Vellius
        Paterculus tells (I, 13) that in sending to Rome what
        might be styled the artistic booty of the destroyed city
        he consigned the statues and paintings to those in charge
        of the transport with the warning that should the goods
        be lost they would be held responsible and would have to
        reproduce them at their own expense&quot; (<i>GAF</i>
        19). Valentine's comparison of modern art collectors to
        those of Rome (and that art collecting started in Rome
        rather than Greece) derives from Nobili's opening
        chapters.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>245.23] the
        point Rome reached when a court could award a painting to
        the man who owned the board: </b>by Roman Emperor
        Justinian's time (sixth century), says Nobili,
        &quot;judges had so lost all sense of art appreciation
        that in a dispute between a painter and the man who had
        furnished the board on which the work was painted, they
        decided that the painting belonged to the one who owned
        the board. Justinian was forced to do justice by stating
        that if a quarrel arose between the artist and the one
        who furnished the board the owner of the work was the
        artist, as the value of the board could not be compared
        with the artistic one&quot; (<i>GAF</i> 64).</font></p>

        Gaddis found the details of the tradition of Hubert's life in EB (9:3) 
        and especially VEF (51 n, 52-63). Although some critics have doubted Hubert's 
        existence, most now believe he began the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb 
        (also known as the Ghent Altarpiece), which was finished by Jan after 
        Hubert's death in 1426. [<a href="../contributorskey.shtml" target="_blank">JSc/SM</a>]</font></p>

        &quot;The Guild System&quot; (<i>VEF</i> 85-100),
        especially p. 93: &quot;He had to take solemn oaths of
        honesty, and to promise that his work should be done as
        in the sight of God. [...] He was not allowed to use any
        except recognized materials and tools. If bad materials
        were found by the guild inspectors in his possession,
        they were destroyed and he was fined.&quot; Earlier in
        the chapter Conway points out: &quot;The student in the
        old days had to know how to make whatever he required.
        Certain colours, indeed, like ultramarine which came from
        Venice and brick-red made in Flanders, could be bought;
        but artists had to know exactly what they wanted, and to
        be able to discriminate between good and bad
        materials&quot; (91).</font></p>

        Mansit odor [...] a goddess had appeared&quot;: </b>commenting
        on the distribution of the gift of tongues at the first
        Pentecost (Acts 2), Conybeare notes: &quot;In the oldest
        Syriac versions of the passage it is added that a sweet
        odour pervaded the house, and this feature was, perhaps,
        eliminated by the Greek editors of Luke's text; it was,
        however, a familiar idea among the ancient pagans that
        the epiphany of a god was attended with a sweet smell,
        and that he left behind an odour of sanctity. Hence the
        line of Ovid: '<i>Mansit odor. Posses scire fuisse deam'</i>
        ('An odour remained. You could tell that a goddess had
        appeared')&quot; (<i>MMM</i> 100). The quoted line is
        from part 5 (May) of the <i>Fasti, </i>Ovid's poetic
        commentary on the Roman calendar, and describes Flora
        (Roman goddess of flowers and spring) at the conclusion
        of the poet's imaginary interview with her concerning her
        annual festival (Floralia). </font></p>
