        all these things, therefore, it is concluded that all
        evil springs from ignorance; and ignorance herself, the
        mother of all evils, is sprung from carelessness and
        sloth, and is nourished, and increased, and rooted in the
        senses of men by negligence; and if any one teach that
        she is to be put to flight, she is with difficulty and
        indignantly torn away, as from an ancient and hereditary
        abode. And therefore we must labor for a little, that we
        may search out the presumption of ignorance, and cut them
        off by means of knowledge, especially in those who are
        preoccupied with some erroneous opinions, by means of
        which ignorance is the more firmly rooted in them, as
        under the appearance of a certain kind of knowledge; for
        nothing is worse than for one to believe that he knows
        what he is ignorant of, and to maintain that to be true
        which is false. This is as if a drunk man [...]&quot;

        elements of the Black Mass. Valentine paraphrases
        Michelet's <i>S&amp;W </i>(102, 106):</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The <i>Black
        Mass, </i>in its primary aspect, would seem to be this
        redemption of Eve from the curse Christianity had laid
        upon her. At the Witches' Sabbath woman fulfills every
        office. She is priest, and altar, and consecrated host,
        whereof all the people communicate. [...] By her
        prostrate body and humiliated person, by the vast silken
        net of her hair, draggled in the dust, she (that proud
        Proserpine) offered up herself as a sacrifice. On her
        loins a demon performed Mass, pronounced the <i>Credo, </i>deposited
        the offertory of the faithful.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Michelet
        speculates the Eucharist used in a Black Mass consisted
        of the same <i>confarreatio</i> used as a love potion.
        The witch would oblige a female customer thus: &quot;On
        her loins she lays a board, and on it a miniature oven,
        in which she bakes the magic cake. . . . 'Sweet friend, I
        can bear no more. Quick, quick, I cannot stay like this!'
        'Nay, madam, [...] 'twill be heated of your very body,
        the hot flame of your passion!'&quot; (97).</font></p>

        Willie: </b>William Gaddis, who makes a few cameo
        appearances in the novel.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>373.1] The </b><b><i>Recognitions</i></b><b>:
        </b>though traditionally ascribed to Clement of Rome, the
        original author of this &quot;theological romance&quot;
        is unknown; it probably came to be attributed to Clement
        as a result of confounding the first-century pope and
        martyr (see 23.25) with Flavius Clement, a kinsman of the
        Roman emperor Domitian. Others have attributed it to
        Bardesanes. Internal evidence suggests the first quarter
        of the third century as a date of composition.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Gaddis may have
        first learned of the Clementine <i>Recognitions</i> from
        Graves, who writes: &quot;According to the Clementines,
        whose religious theory is popularized in a novel called <i>The
        Recognitions, </i>the identity of true religion in all
        ages depends on a series of incarnations of the Wisdom of
        God, of which Adam was the first and Jesus the
        last.&quot; He adds in a note: &quot;Voltaire modelled
        his <i>Candide</i> on it; and it has the distinction of
        appearing in the select list of books in Milton's <i>Areopagitica,
        </i>along with John Skelton's <i>Poems, </i>as deserving
        of permanent suppression&quot; (<i>WG </i>132 and note;
        but Milton's reference is to the books of Clement of <i>Alexandria
        - </i>see next annotation).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Frazer and
        Lethaby also refer to the novel, as does James, who gives
        this convenient summary (<i>ANT </i>xxiv-xxv):</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The
        setting is derived from secular romance; it is the
        ancient theme of the members of a family parted from one
        another by a series of accidents for many years, and in
        the end reunited: in this case it is Clement's family.
        His parents, his brothers, and himself are brought
        together by the agency of St. Peter. This setting is
        filled in, and indeed completely overlaid, by the matter
        which conveys the real purpose of the book, namely, the
        discourses of Peter; partly his debates with Simon Magus,
        and partly his unopposed expositions of doctrine.
        [&quot;Mostly talk, talk, talk,&quot; as Valentine
        correctly observes.]</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The
        body of the doctrine thus set forth is not orthodox. It
        is, in fact, eccentric. At one time it was contended that
        these books were precious monuments of a condition of the
        Church in primitive times, when the Twelve were in
        opposition to Paul; it being doubtless the case that
        Simon Magus in these books is to some extent Paul under a
        mask. But it is now recognized that the books are not
        only rather late in date (not earlier than the end of the
        third or beginning of the fourth century), but also that
        they do not represent the views of a large school of
        thought, but of a small and obscure sect.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The
        Greek form of the romance consists of twenty so-called
        Homilies - the Clementine <i>Homilies. </i>The Latin is a
        version of another form, expurgated and translated by
        Rufinus in the fourth century. It is in ten books, and is
        called the Clementine <i>Recognitions. </i></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">An English
        translation by the Reverend Thomas Smith appeared in 1906
        in vol. 8 of <i>The Ante-Nicene Fathers, </i>ed.
        Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson (New York:
        Scribner's).</font></p>

        Clement of <i>Alexandria</i> (?. 150-217), head of the
        catechetical school of Alexandria and author of numerous
        works (see 315.35).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>373.3] he
        goes to Egypt: </b>in 1.5 Clement announces his intention
        to go to Egypt to &quot;cultivate the friendship of the
        hierophants or prophets, who preside at the shrines. Then
        I shall win over a magician by money, and entreat him, by
        what they call the necromantic art, to bring me a soul
        from the infernal regions, as if I were desirous of
        consulting it about some business. But this shall be my
        consultation, whether the soul be immortal.&quot; But
        shortly thereafter he hears of Christ and abandons his
        plans for Egypt.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>373.5]
        beginning of the whole Faust legend: </b>Clement's father
        is named Faustinianus, and Clement has a set of young
        twin brothers named Faustinus and Faustus (9.5). But it
        is Clement's initial assumption that the magicians of
        Egypt (rather than God) can lead him to salvation and his
        plan to summon &quot;a soul from the infernal
        regions&quot; that anticipate Faust's pact with
        Mephistopheles and thus originates the Faust legend. 


 Gaddis's source for the connection between the Clementine <i>Recognitions</i> and
 the Faust legend was probably <i>The Sources of the Faust
 Tradition</i> by Philip
 Mason Palmer and Robert Pattison More (NY: Oxford Univ Press, 1936), who devote
 most of their second chapter to this topic.
