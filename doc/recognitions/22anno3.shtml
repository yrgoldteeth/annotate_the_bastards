        the measure of the world's motion. And time past and time
        future are infinite, but time present is finite&quot; (<i>LEP

        The paradox is that Achilles can never overtake the

        Averroes: </b>the Latin name of ibn-Rushd (1126-98),
        Spanish Arab philosopher and physician. His Neoplatonic
        view of Aristotle gave rise to several doctrines that
        were formally anathematized in 1270.</font></p>

        ut intelligam: </b>for Saint Anselm (see 103.34);
        &quot;the starting-point of all theological speculation
        must be faith, <i>Credo ut intelligam. </i>'He who does
        not believe will not experience, and he who has not
        experienced will not understand.' And once confirmed in
        faith it is our duty to demonstrate by reason the truth
        of that which we believe&quot; (<i>EB </i>2:11). Wyatt's
        attribution of this line to Averroes is repeated by
        Anselm later (458.28-30); apparently Averroes and Saint
        Anselm borrowed (plagiarized?) from the same source, for
        in Saint Augustine's <i>On the Gospel of Saint John </i>we
        read: &quot;Understanding is the reward of faith.
        Therefore seek not to understand that thou mayest
        believe, but believe that thou mayest understand.&quot;
        Saint Anselm's formulation appears in his famous <i>Proslogion,
        </i>which is again quoted at 535.6 ff.</font></p>

        Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church&quot;
        (Matt. 16:18); earlier he had told Peter and his brother
        Andrew: &quot;Follow me, and I will make you fishers of
        men&quot; (4:9). Conybeare questions the authenticity of
        this invitation (<i>MMM</i> 29). </font></p>

        Paul, to Philippi: </b>Acts 16:9-40 relates how Paul,
        inspired by a vision, travels to Philippi (in Macedonia),
        where he and his comrades are imprisoned. Their prayers
        and singing at night cause an earthquake to destroy the
        prison, after which the Roman authorities ask them to
        leave. The episode has been called &quot;patently
        unhistorical.&quot;</font></p>

        Matthew 27, Judas Iscariot (Hebrew Ish Kerioth: &quot;the
        man of Kerioth&quot;) hangs himself; the chief priests
        thereupon take his silver and buy a field &quot;to bury
        strangers in.&quot; But in Acts 1:18, Judas himself buys
        &quot;a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling
        headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his
        bowels gushed out.&quot; In their <i>Nazarene Gospel
        Restored, </i>Robert Graves and Joshua Podro (they who
        found Paul's adventure &quot;patently unhistorical&quot;)
        find Matthew's account the more &quot;historically

      <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">On July 21, 1773, appeared 
        the Brief of Suppression, <i>Dominus ac Redemptor Noster</i> [<i>Our Lord 
        and Savior</i>]<i> . </i>This Brief (not a Bull) is narrative rather than 
        judicial in tone. Clement XIV. cited certain past difficulties of the 
        Society and enumerated present complaints against it, notably charges 
        of political and mercantile activities and the hostility of the Bourbon 
        Courts and of Portugal. The Pope thus concluded the Brief: &quot;For the 
        sake of peace, and because the Society can no longer attain the aims for 
        which it was founded, and on secret grounds which we enclose in our heart, 
        we suppress the said Society.&quot;</font></p>

        necessary to punish in order to prove it had the power of

        the book under this title (<i>IP </i>211), but Gaddis's source for the

        <br>
        </font><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Paracelsus had used 
        antimony under the name of stibium, but later the name was changed and 
        the drug popularized by a medical book published in 1604 and entitled 
        <i>The Triumphant Chariot of Antimony. </i>The author's name was given 
        as Basile Valentine, a monk, but it is doubtful if such a person existed, 
        and it is believed that an alchemist wrote the book. The origin of the 
        name antimony as given in this book is as follows: The author alleges 
        that he had observed that some pigs which had eaten food containing antimony 
        became very fat. He was led by this observation to try what effect it 
        would have on some monks who had become emaciated as a result of prolonged 
        fasting. He tried the experiment; the monks all died. Hence the name stibium 
        was replaced by antimony, meaning antagonist to monks.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">An
        early legend has, however, been handed down from Celsus,
        a Jew who lived about the time of Hadrian. The work
        containing this legend has been lost, and is known only
        through fragments which Origen has preserved [in his <i>Contra
        Celsum</i>: see 420.12]. In substance it amounts to this.
        A beautiful young woman lived with her mother in a
        neglected caphar. This young woman, whose name was Mirjam
        - Mary - supported herself by needlework. She became
        betrothed to a carpenter, broke her vows in favor of a
        soldier named Panthera, and wandering away gave birth to
        a male child called Jeschu, - Jeschu being a contraction
        of the Hebrew Jehoshua, of which Jesus is the Greek form.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>384.25] the
        whole thing hangs on a resurrection that only one lunatic
        saw [...] visions are contagious: </b>&quot;On the
        experience of Cephas [Peter], then, the entire history of
        the resurrection hinges,&quot; writes Conybeare (<i>MMM</i>
        289), who cites Paul's version as the earliest account:
        &quot;And that he was buried, and that he rose again the
        third day according to the scriptures: And that he was
        seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was
        seen above five hundred brethren at once&quot; (1 Cor.
        15:4-6, quoted in <i>MMM</i> 288). Conybeare explains:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">In the
        earliest form of gospel tradition Peter is the leader and
        spokesman of Jesus's followers; if he was once convinced
        that Jesus had been raised from the dead and had appeared
        to him, he was sure to suggestionise the rest of the
        twelve companions into seeing visions like his own; they
        in turn would be capable of suggestionising the much
        larger number specified by Paul, of whom many were yet
        alive when the letter to the Corinthians was written. In
        the history of religious enthusiasm we find nothing so
        contagious as visions. (<i>MMM</i> 288)</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Conybeare
        describes the psychological state Peter had reached by
        the time of Christ's crucifixion - a state in which
        hallucinations might occur - but Wyatt's description of
        Peter as a &quot;lunatic&quot; is perhaps going too far.
        See <i>MMM</i> 289-93 for the development of the
        resurrection legend by way of the Gospels' conflicting
        accounts. </font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>384.28] the
        streets were full of messiahs spreading discontent: </b>cf.
        Conybeare: &quot;It need hardly be observed that, if
        Pilate was really convinced of Jesus's innocence, he
        could have released him at once. But Jesus's admission
        before him that he was King of the Jews or Messiah, in a
        period when the Roman Government was perpetually menaced
        by such pretenders, left no alternative but to condemn
        him&quot; (<i>MMM</i> 280).</font></p>

        Christ was thrown into a pit for common malefactors: </b>finding
        the Gospels' account of Christ's burial unacceptable, the
        French priest and scholar &quot;Abbé Loisy suggests that
        Jesus was more probably thrown into the common pit
        reserved for crucified malefactors, and that the episode
        of his burial by Joseph [of Arimathea in Luke 23:50-53]
        was invented by his followers at a later day to save him
        from the reproach of a dishonourable interment&quot; (<i>MMM</i>

        significant that this barbarous sacrifice was offered by
        the kings at the grave of Osiris. We may conjecture that
        the victims represented Osiris himself, who was annually
        slain, dismembered, and buried in their persons that he

        from Lethaby: &quot;One of the rulers of Cairo, the son
        of Ibn-Tulun, who succeeded him in 883, seems to have set
        himself to rival the garden of delights in a 'paradise.'
        [...] 'But the chief wonder [...] was a lake of
        quicksilver; on the surface of this lake lay a feather
        bed inflated with air, fastened by silk bands to four
        silver supports at the corners; here alone the
        insomnolent sovereign could take his rest&quot; (<i>AMM </i>104,
        quoting Lane-Poole's <i>Art of the Saracens</i>). </font></p>

        egg that Leda laid: </b>cf. Ortega y Gasset: &quot;The
        romantics of every period have been excited by those
        scenes of violation, in which the natural and infrahuman
        assaults the white form of woman, and they have depicted
        Leda and the swan, Pasiphae and the bull, Antiope and the
        goat&quot; (<i>RM </i>88).</font></p>
