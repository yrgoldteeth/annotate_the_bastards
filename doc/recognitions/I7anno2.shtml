        [...] Gervase of Tilbury: </b>a collection of medieval legends and superstitions 
        recorded for Otto IV of Germany by Gervase (fl. 1211), English ecclesiastic 
        and writer. The anecdote, as noted earlier (28.32), is from Lethaby (<i>AMM 
        </i>15). </font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>257.17] heaven and earth joined 
        by a tree [...] sky is a roof: </b>from <i>AMM</i> 12, quoting from Sir 
        Edward Burnett Tylor's <i>Researches into the Early History of Mankind 
        and the Development of Civilisation </i>(3d ed., 1878):</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">&quot;The sky is to most 
        savages, what is called in the South American language, 'the earth on 
        high,' and we can quite understand the thought of some Paraguayans that 
        at death their souls would go up to heaven by the tree which joins earth 
        and sky. There are holes or windows through the sky-roof or firmament 
        where the rain comes through; and if you climb high enough, you can get 
        through and visit the dwellers above, who look and talk and live very 
        much in the same way as the people upon earth.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>257.28] Someone, who was it? 
        said maybe we're fished for: </b>Charles Fort; see 87.8.</font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>257.32] seven heavens of the 
        Arabs: </b>from <i>AMM</i> 24, quoting from Stanley Lane-Poole's <i>The 
        Art of the Saracens in Egypt</i> (1886):</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">&quot;According to the 
        common opinion of the Arabs, there are seven heavens, one above another, 
        and seven earths, one beneath another; the earth which we inhabit being 
        the highest of the latter, and next below the lowest heaven. [...] Traditions 
        differ respecting the fabric of the seven heavens. In the most credible 
        account, according to a celebrated historian, the first is described as 
        formed of emerald; the second of white silver; the third of large white 
        pearls; the fourth of ruby; the fifth of red gold; the sixth of yellow 
        jacinth; and the seventh of shining light.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>258.2] Lilies [...] an </b><b><i>Annunciation</i></b><b>: 
        </b>the lily, &quot;the flower of pur-i-ty&quot; as Esme says (271.21-22), 
        is traditionally associated with the Virgin Mary, and particularly associated 
        in painting with the Annunciation, in which lilies either are held by 
        the archangel or (as Wyatt intends) are present in a vase.</font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>258.17] Tertullian: </b>(ca.160-230), 
        Latin ecclesiastical writer; Valentine is reading his<i> De Virginibus

        mentions this trick in his <i>GAF </i>(254). </font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>258.40] Italia irredenta: </b>&quot;Unredeemed 
        Italy&quot; was the name given to Italian-speaking areas still under foreign 
        control from 1861 to 1920. The term <i>irredentism</i> is thus used for 
        any nationalistic movement seeking to break away from foreign rule and 
        rejoin others of the same nationality.</font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>260.19] eighteenth-century Spanish

      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>261.27] the renegade painter: 
        </b>a phrase sometimes used to describe Cavaradossi in <i>Tosca.</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>261.37] money [...] binds the 
        contract: </b>Minkoff (247) suggests this is a &quot;parodic debasement&quot; 
        of the blood contract made by Mephistopheles with Faust (ll. 1737-40).</font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>262.8] Somerset Maugham: </b>(1874-1965), 
        English writer; his <i>Razor's Edge</i> is mentioned at 638.25.</font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>262.17] Momus and Vulcan: </b>this 
        anecdote is recorded in one of the satirical dialogues of the Greek author 
        Lucian (ca. 120-ca. 180), but Gaddis's source unknown.</font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>262.28] a hero? John Huss: </b>see 
        32.20.</font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>264.10] Emerson's advice [...] 
        perhaps they are: </b>&quot;Emerson recommended us to treat people as 
        though they were real, and added, 'Perhaps they are.' But the doubt that 
        lingered in the mind of the stately pantheist never entered into that 
        of the Hindu&quot; (<i>AN </i>6). The quotation is from Emerson's essay 
        &quot;Experience&quot; and is repeated at 315.17.</font></p>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>265.2] </b><b><i>What you seek

        made by Thoreau to Emerson and recorded in the latter's eulogy &quot;Thoreau&quot; 
        (<i>Atlantic Monthly, </i>August 1862). Walking one day with his friend, 
        Thoreau</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">heard a note which he 
          called that of the night-warbler, a bird he had never identified, had 
          been in search of twelve years, which always, when he saw it, was in 
          the act of diving down into a tree or bush, and which it was vain to 
          seek; the only bird which sings indifferently by night and by day. I 
          told him he must beware of finding and booking it, lest life should 
          have nothing more to show him. He said, &quot;What you seek in vain 
          for, half your life, one day you come full upon, all the family at dinner. 
          You seek it like a dream, and as soon as you find it you become its 
          prey.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Valentine appears to be reading 
        <i>Walden</i>: Emerson's quotation is cited in Byron Rees's introduction 
        to his frequently reprinted edition of 1910<i>, </i>and in some editions 
        of <i>Walden </i>Emerson's essay has been printed in full as an introduction. 
        Gaddis later used this quote as the epigraph to <i>A Frolic of His Own. 
        </i>For the significance of this quotation, see J. M. Tyree's &#8220;Henry

        (<i>AMM</i> 42, quoting from the Comte de Vogüé's <i>La Syrie Centrale</i> 
        [1865-67]).</font></p>

        of how an Australian aborigine may have described his religion to an early 
        settler named Manning, who later used Christian terminology to describe 
        aborigine beliefs, making explicit parallels between the two religions. 
        But Frazer says of Manning that his &quot;evidence on [many] matters of 
        Australian beliefs is open to grave doubt&quot; (unabridged <i>GB</i>,

        known to the nuns by the delicious scent that clung even to the flags 
        whereon she had trod.&quot; Thus, Summers concludes, &quot;'The odour

        the first story in the Brothers Grimm's <i>Kinder- und Hausmarchen </i>(Nursery 
        and Household Tales, 1812), the tale of a frog who returns a princess's 
        ball from a well in exchange for becoming her friend. Her father the king 
        forces the fickle princess to honor her agreement, but later in a fit 
        of anger she hurls the frog against her bedroom wall, and he falls to 
        the ground a prince. He had been bewitched years before, and upon now 
        being released he marries the princess. The translation that Wyatt interrupts 
        concludes: &quot;that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished
