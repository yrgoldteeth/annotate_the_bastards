        Brooks (1910-2002).wrote and recorded this song ca. 1946; it appears on 
        an album entitled <i>Diverse Songs and Moods: Stella Brooks &amp; Greta 
        Keller</i> (Folkways Records, 1981). A short woman, she is described in 
        the liner notes as having &quot;dark hair in a page-boy bob and blue eyes.&quot;

        corruption of the Renaissance papacy: &quot;Of Sextus
        IV., Infessura says, in words that are best left
        untranslated, 'Puerum amator et sodomita fuit.' And it
        would appear, not only that he was guilty of these
        charming practices, but that he granted indulgences for
        their general commission&quot; (<i>AN </i>100).* Sixtus
        IV was pope from 1471-84; Stefano Infessura (ca. 1435-ca.
        1500) was an Italian historian; see Summers' note on him
        in <i>MM </i>(xxv, n.). The Latin phrase, which
        translates &quot;he was a lover of boys and a
        sodomite,&quot; is from his notorious <i>Diarium urbis
        Romae. </i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">*Gaddis
        followed Saltus in the first edition of <i>R, </i>but
        corrected &quot;Sextus&quot; to &quot;Sixtus&quot; and
        &quot;puerum&quot; to &quot;puerorum&quot; in later
        editions; these errors appear in the first edition of <i>The
        Anatomy of Negation</i> (New York: Scribner and Welford,
        1886) and in Brentano's 1925 reprint, one of which Gaddis
        obviously used, but were corrected in the revised edition
        of <i>AN</i> published by Belford, Clarke &amp; Company
        in 1889.</font></p>

        festival of expiation, later of fertility, celebrated on
        February 15. Roman women, to ensure fertility (and not
        necessarily naked), would put forth their hands to be
        stricken with the leather thongs carried by young men
        (Luperci) appointed to celebrate the festival. In 494
        Pope Gelasius I changed the day to that of the

        [...] evil angels: </b>adapted from Conybeare (<i>MMM </i>232-33):</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The
        idea that spirits, especially evil ones, approach women
        through the ear, which these early legends of the Virgin
        Mary embody, was an old Rabbinic one, found in the
        Talmud, in Philo, Josephus, and, above all, in Paul. The
        latter, in I Corinthians, ch. xi., forbids a woman &quot;<i>to
        pray or prophesy with her head unveiled. She must carry
        on her head a talisman </i>(<i>lit. </i>power), <i>because
        of the angels.</i>&quot; Tertullian, the earliest of the
        Christian Fathers to comment on this passage, explains
        that evil angels were ever lurking about ready to assail
        even married women, much more virgins, through their
        ears. From this point of view he penned his weighty
        treatise, <i>De Virginibus Velandis</i> - &quot;On the
        Necessity of Veiling Virgins&quot;; and the Church has
        been careful, in devising a dress for nuns, who are
        espoused to Christ, to cover up their ears and protect
        them from this class of risk.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>313.9] The
        Virgin conceived that way, the Logos entered her ears: </b>an
        early Christian belief, based on earlier Egyptian
        beliefs; see <i>MMM</i> 230-34. The Logos is, of course,
        the Word of God (John 1:1; cf. <i>Faust</i> 1224-37).</font></p>

        he repudiated the marriage and in 1196 married Agnes,
        daughter of Bertold IV, duke of Meran. The marriage was
        opposed by Popes Celestine III and Innocent III, and in
        1201 Philip agreed to separate from Agnes (who died later
        that year). Ingeborg was kept in prison until 1213. The
        details of Philip's marital history may be from <i>EB </i>(17:718);
