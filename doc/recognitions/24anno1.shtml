        &quot;I've had a good dream [...] </b><b><i>Brothers
        Karamazov</i></b><b>: </b>the last sentence of part 9,
        chap. 8. Mitya falls asleep at the end of the examination
        of witnesses at his trial and dreams of poor peasants.
        &quot;And he felt that a passion of pity, such as he had
        never known before, was rising in his heart, that he
        wanted to cry, that he wanted to do something for them
        all, so that the babe should weep no more, so that the
        dark-faced, dried-up mother should not weep, that no one
        should shed tears again from that moment, and he wanted
        to do it at once, at once, regardless of all obstacles,
        with all the recklessness of the Karamazovs&quot;
        (Constance Garnett translation). Upon waking, he
        discovers that someone has placed a pillow beneath his
        head. Under the dual influence of the unexpected kindness
        and the inspiring dream, he agrees to sign whatever the
        authorities wish. </font></p>

        Gaddis saw when <i>The Recognitions</i> was already at

        novel was about that he inserted it at some added
        expense,&quot; except that the &quot;worthless old
        painting&quot; (450.40) was actually &quot;a fairly good
        19th century painting&quot; (Koenig, &quot;'Splinters

        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">In a
        letter dated 6th July, 1591, only five months before his
        death, when already he had been &quot;thrown into a
        corner like an old rag&quot; - to use his own phrase -
        St. John says to a nun [María de la Encarnación], who
        bewailed the seeming triumph of his persecutors and
        enemies, &quot;As to my affairs, daughter, let them not
        trouble you, for none of them trouble me. [...] These
        things are not done by men, but by God, Who knows what is
        meet for us and ordains things for our good. Think only
        that God ordains all. And where there is no love,
        stablish love there, and you will find love.&quot;</font></p>

        is Tolstoy's interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount
        and an exposition of the principles of civic
        nonresistance (which greatly influenced Gandhi). It also
        attacks institutional Christianity and advocates a return

        Dostoevski: </b>in a chapter of <i>The Possessed </i>long
        suppressed, Stavrogin describes a sexual encounter with a
        twelve-year-old girl who, feeling afterward that she has
        &quot;killed God&quot; as a result, hangs herself.
        Similarly, the profligate Svidrigaylov in <i>Crime and
        Punishment</i> admits to having sexually abused young
        girls, one of whom committed suicide afterward. Toward
        the end of the novel he dreams of rescuing a shivering,
        crying, five-year-old girl, undressing her, and allowing
        her to take his bed to recover. He soon sees in her
        countenance, however, &quot;the face of a courtesan, the
        brazen face of a mercenary French harlot.&quot; Shortly
        after waking from this nightmare, Svidrigaylov shoots

        sculpture is featured in the February 1952 issue of <i>Art

        critical remarks quoted by Max are not from <i>Art News</i>

        arms and the double image it forms of a bull's head are
