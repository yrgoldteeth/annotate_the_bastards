        Run now [...] II Kings 4:26: </b>from the story of the
        prophet Elisha and the Shunammite woman. In return for
        her hospitality, he had granted the barren woman a son,
        who later dies. Going to Elisha to report his death, she
        overtakes him on the road. Elisha sends his servant to
        ask if all is well, but she answers falsely (4:26), only
        later confessing the true situation to Elisha, who then
        returns to her home and restores the boy to life. The
        episode has been interpreted as a prophecy of Christ's
        resurrection. (In light of Gaddis's acquaintance with
        Robert Graves, the choice of epigraph may owe something
        to the latter's novelistic treatment <i>My Head! My
        Head!, </i>&quot;Being the History of Elisha and the
        Shunammite Woman; with the History of Moses as Elisha
        related it, and her Questions put to him&quot; [1925];
        there, Elisha sacrifices his own life to bring the child
        back to life.)</font></p>

        Virgin of Rimini: </b>one of Marsh's objects of scorn:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">A few
        years ago, the Virgin of Rimini, which represents a
        numerous class, the automatic or pantomimic Madonnas, was
        in high repute; but the profane hands of the Piedmontese
        civil and military authorities have detected and exposed
        the springs, cords, pulleys, and other contrivances by
        which so many sacred pictures and statues were made to
        roll the eyes, to shed tears, and make puppet-like
        gestures, that they have fallen rather into discredit.
        The Virgin of Rimini is a picture of some merit, given by
        the family of the artist to a church at Rimini in 1810.
        It manifested no signs of life until 1850, when it was
        observed by three ladies to roll its eyes upward until
        the pupil disappeared beneath the upper eyelid, nothing
        but the white remaining visible. This graceful and
        expressive movement was repeated during the following
        days, and after some weeks' practice the image acquired
        the valuable additional accomplishments of turning the
        eye-balls laterally, and even rolling them in different
        directions at the same time. The prodigy excited great
        attention, the bishop took the matter in hand, and it was
        swiftly laid before the pope himself, by whose orders an
        ecclesiastical commission was organized to inquire into
        the genuineness of the miracle. [...] The pope authorized
        the coronation of the image in his name, and bestowed
        upon all who should visit the Church on the day of
        coronation, or within fifteen days afterward, and perform
        the required services, plenary indulgence and remission
        of all sins, transferable, <i>per modum suffragii</i>, to
        any of their friends in purgatory. (<i>MMSM </i>150-51)</font></p>

        an allusion to the same text &quot;Dick&quot; had used
        earlier (718.13): &quot;For the Jews require a sign, and
        the Greeks seek after wisdom: But we preach Christ
        crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto
        Greeks foolishness&quot; (1 Cor. 1:22-23).</font></p>

        freed from slavery, and the <i>Chapel, </i>containing the
        'Virgen de Guadalupe' [...]. The Gothic <i>Church</i> is
        very imposing, though the effect is somewhat marred by
        the over-massive coro. The latter has a superb reja by <i>Francisco
        de Salamanca</i> and <i>Juan de Avila</i> (1520). The
        Renaissance retablo in the capilla mayor is by <i>Juan
        Gómez de Mora </i>[...]. The tombs of <i>Henry IV. of
        Castile</i> and <i>Constable Alonso Velasco</i> are also

Only the tiny image of a man, he still has life, he still is able to express himself. And what he says is a maxim of such general application that one begins to suspect Goethe of having seized upon this truth long before and of having imagined Homunculus merely in order to express it. '<em>Was k&uuml;nstlich ist verlangt geschlossnen Raum</em>.' All art requires a closed space: it is an aphorism that soon became famous&quot; (<em>Imaginary Interviews</em>, trans. Malcolm Cowley [NY: Knopf, 1944], 92-93; repeated on p. 105).{Mark Hale}<br>
