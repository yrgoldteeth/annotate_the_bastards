        The quotation is from a chapter entitled &quot;Tableau x Anciens,&quot;

        of autographs:</b> as an example of &quot;how a man can
        be great in his own specialty, yet likely to be taken in
        under peculiar and rather astonishing
        circumstances,&quot; Nobili (<i>GAF</i> 200-201)
        instances a collection of autographs sold to French
        mathematician Michel Chasles (1793-1880) by a forger
        named Vrain-Lucas:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Among
        other things there was included: a private letter of
        Alexander the Great addressed to Aristotle; a letter of
        Cleopatra to Julius Cæsar, informing the Roman Dictator
        that their son &quot;Cesarion&quot; was getting on very
        well; a missive of Lazarus to St. Peter; also a lengthy
        epistle addressed to Lazarus by Mary Magdalen. It should
        be added that the letters were written in French and in
        what might be styled an eighteenth-century jargon, that
        Alexander addressed Aristotle as <i>Mon Ami</i> and
        Cleopatra scribbled to Cæsar: <i>Notre fils Cesarion va
        bien. </i>Lazarus, no less a scholar in the Gallic idiom,
        and to whom, maybe, a miraculous resurrection had
        prompted a new personality, writes to St. Peter in the
        spirit of a rhetorician and a prig, speaking of Cicero's
        oratory and Cæsar's writings, getting excited and
        anathematic on Druidic rites and their cruel habit <i>de
        sacrifier des hommes saulxvaiges.</i></font></p>
        
      <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Mary Magdalen, who begins 
        her letter with a <i>mon très aimé frère Lazarus, ce que me mandez de 
        Petrus l'apostre de notre doux Jesus,</i> is supposed to be writing from 
        Marseilles and thus would appear to be the only one out of the many who 
        can logically indulge in French, the <i>jargon-bouillabaisse</i> that 
        Vrain-Lucas lent to the gallant array of his personages.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">After
        such a practical joke played on the excellent good faith
        of M. Chasles, some of the other autographs seem tame.
        The package, however, also contained scraps jotted down
        by Alcibiades and Pericles, a full confession of Judas
        Iscariot's crime written by himself to Mary Magdalen
        before passing the rope round his neck; a letter of
        Pontius Pilate addressed to Tiberius expressing his
        sorrow for the death of Christ. Other astounding pieces
        of this now famous collection were: a passport signed by
        Vercingetorix, a poem of Abelard and some love-letters
        addressed by Laura to Petrarch, as well as many other
        historical documents down to a manuscript of Pascal and
        an exchange of letters between the French scientist and
        Newton on the laws of gravitation, the Frenchman claiming
        the discovery as his own. [...] Among other historical
        blunders is the supposition that Newton could have
        exchanged letters with Pascal on the laws of gravitation.
        The former being but nine years old when Pascal died, he
        had certainly not yet given his mind to the observations
        bringing about his marvellous discovery.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">(Gaddis followed
        Nobili's own blunder regarding Newton's age in the first
        edition, but corrected &quot;nine&quot; to
        &quot;nineteen&quot; for later editions.)</font></p>

        these two peasant children at La Salette in southern
        France on 19 September 1846. The message she confided to
        them (the necessity of penance) was communicated to Pope
        Pius IX in 1851 and has since been known as the

        Devotion of the Perpetual Rosary: </b>one of many
        devotions that sprang up in France in the nineteenth
        century. Marsh explains (<i>MMSM </i>161): </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The
        splendid success of La Salette soon led to new attempts
        to get up analogous manifestations elsewhere, but, as we
        have hinted, they were often smothered by the local
        jealousies of the clergy. A late movement in favor of the
        Perpetual Rosary of Mary was formidable enough to
        threaten not only La Salette and Lourdes, but even the
        Sacré C&#156;ur, and it was defeated only by a solemn
        resolution of the General Congress of the French Catholic
        Committees at Paris. At this congress, as appears by
        recent journals, Père Edouard, a Dominican, urged, as an
        infallible means to save France and the Church, the
        Devotion of the Perpetual Rosary, while Père Ramière, a
        Jesuit, stoutly defended the Devotion of the Sacred Heart
        as more efficacious. Monseigneur de Ségur said that the
        Holy Virgin shows <i>very good taste</i> by choosing
        France for the theatre of her apparitions, and that
        Gallicism in France is dead and buried since the 19th of
        July, 1870 [when France declared war on Prussia]. He
        declared himself in favor of the Sacred Heart, which was
        finally sustained against the Perpetual Rosary.</font></p>

        of Lourdes: </b>in 1858, a peasant girl named Bernadette
        Soubirous (1844-79) claimed that the Virgin Mary -
        identifying herself as the Immaculate Conception - had
        appeared to her on eighteen occasions. A spring with
        miraculous healing powers supposedly appeared at the same
        time, and after Bernadette's visions were legitimized,
        the pilgrimage to Lourdes received ecclesiastical
        recognition in 1862 (<i>MMSM</i> 163-74; the details on
        &quot;85 liters per minute&quot; and taxation
        difficulties are from a footnote on pp. 170-71).

        once the body of Dionysius [the Greek form of Denis]
        stood erect, and took his head in its hands; and with an
        angel guiding it and a great light going before, it
        walked for two miles, from the place called Montmartre to
        the place where by its own choice and by the providence
        of God, it now reposes&quot; (Jacobus de Voragine's <i>Golden
        Legend</i>). See 938.26 for Madame du Deffand's captious
        comment on this feat.</font></p>

        &quot;public utility&quot;: </b>&quot;France professes to
        recognize the legal equality of Protestant and Catholic
        churches,&quot; Marsh writes, &quot;and has no national,
        no State religion; but the recent action of the
        Legislative Assembly, prompted by Jesuit influence, in
        declaring the construction of a church dedicated to the
        Sacred Heart, on the heights of Montmartre, to be a work
        of 'public utility,' is very nearly the equivalent to a
        formal recognition of that devotion as the religion of
        the State&quot; (<i>MMSM </i>112 n.).</font></p>
