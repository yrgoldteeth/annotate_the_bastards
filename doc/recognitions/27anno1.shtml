        Murti-Bing: </b>&quot;The Pill of Murti-Bing&quot; is the
        title of the first chapter of Czeslaw Milosz's <i>The
        Captive Mind</i> (trans. Jane Zielonko [New York: Knopf,
        1953]). Gaddis informed me it first &quot;appeared as
        'The Happiness Pill' in Partisan Review Sept-Oct 1951
        which must be where I saw it. Milosz is describing a 1932
        novel of Witkiewicz titled INSATIABILITY with which I'm
        not familiar&quot; (WG/SM). Milosz describes his fellow
        Pole's dystopian novel (actually published in 1930; an
        English translation appeared in 1977) as follows:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Witkiewicz's
            heroes are unhappy in that they have no faith and no
            sense of meaning in their work. This atmosphere of decay
            and senselessness extends throughout the entire country.
            And at that moment, a great number of hawkers appear in
            the cities peddling Murti-Bing pills. Murti-Bing was a
            Mongolian philosopher who had succeeded in producing an
            organic means of transporting a &quot;philosophy of
            life.&quot; This Murti-Bing &quot;philosophy of
            life,&quot; which constituted the strength of the
            Sino-Mongolian army, was contained in pills in an
            extremely condensed form. A man who used these pills
            changed completely. He became serene and happy. [...] A
            man who swallowed Murti-Bing pills became impervious to
            any metaphysical concerns. The excesses into which art
            falls when people vainly seek in form the wherewithal to
            appease their spiritual hunger were but outmoded
            stupidities for him.</font></p>
        </blockquote>        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Milosz compares
        those who embrace communism - especially intellectuals -
        to Witkiewicz's Murti-Bing addicts.</font></p>

        by that novel, <i>And He Hid Himself </i>(<i>Ed Egli Si
        Nascose, </i>1945) concerns a leftist agitator in
        Mussolini's Italy named Murica who betrays his comrades
        to the police. He develops a &quot;horror of
        impunity&quot; and, after years of disbelief, begins
        yearning for the existence of God. &quot;If I finally
        decided to confess everything,&quot; he tells the leftist
        leader who threatens to kill him, &quot;taking no thought
        of the consequences, it was with the deliberate and
        clear-cut intent of setting up order once again between
        the world and myself, of restoring the ancient boundary
        between good and evil, without which I couldn't go on
        living any more&quot; (trans. Darina Tranquilli [New
        York: Harper Bros., 1945], 100). Murica rejoins his

        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Plato,
            alike in the <i>Phaedrus</i> and in the <i>Symposium</i>,
            speaks of a frenzy that, spreading from the body, infects
            the spirit with malignant humors. This is not love as he
            commends it. But there is, he says, another kind of
            frenzy or delirium which is neither conceived nor born in
            a man's soul except by the inspiration of heaven. It is
            alien to us, its spell is wrought from without; it is a
            transport, an infinite rapture away from reason and
            natural sense. It is therefore to be called <i>enthusiasm,
            </i>a word which actually means &quot;possessed by a
            god,&quot; for the frenzy not only is of heavenly origin,
            but culminates at its highest in a new attainment of the
            divine.</font></p>

                I now will you impart, <br>
                That cannot fail to terror strike, <br>
                To every human heart. <br>
                The deeds of Mary Arnold, <br>
                Who does in a jail deplore, <br>
                Oh! such a dreadful tale as this, <br>
                Was never told before. <br>
                <br>
                Chorus. <br>
                This wretched woman's dreadful deed, <br>
                Does every one affright, <br>
                With black beetles in walnut shells, <br>
                She deprived her child of sight. <br>
                Now think you tender parents, <br>
                What must this monster feel, <br>
                The heart within her breast must ten <br>
                Times harder be than steel. <br>
                <strong>The dreadful crime she did commit, <br>
                </strong><strong>Does all the world surprise, <br>
                </strong><strong>Black beetles placed in walnut shells</strong>, <br>

                This dreadful deed, as you may read, <br>

              A lady saw this monster, <br>
              In the street when passing by, <br>
              And she was struck with terror, <br>
              For to hear the infant cry. <br>
              The infant's face she swore to see, <br>
              Which filled her with surprise, <br>
              To see the fatal bandage, <br>
              Tied round the infant's eyes. <br>
              <br>
              With speed she called an officer, <br>
              Oh! shocking to relate, <br>
              Who beheld the deed, and took the wretch, <br>
              Before the Magistrate. <br>
              Who committed her for trial, <br>
              Which did the wretch displease, <br>
              And she's now transported ten long years, <br>
              Across the briny seas. </p>
              <p>Is there another in the world, <br>
                Could plan such wicked deed, <br>
                No one upon this earth before, <br>
                Of such did ever see. <br>
                To take away her infant's sight, <br>
                'Tis horrible to tell, <br>
                Binding black beetles round it's eyes, <br>
            Placed in walnut shells.</p></td>

        hate them for the harm: </b>Fedya, separated from his
        wife Lisa, fakes a suicide to leave her free to marry a
        childhood sweetheart. He relates the story in a bar (2.1:
        the scene from which Feddle quotes), where he is
        overheard and arrested. Learning at his trial that either
        exile or an annulment of Lisa's second marriage will
        occur, Fedya shoots himself.</font></p>

        Russian title, <i>Zhivoi trup </i>(1900), is properly

        in New York (1918); Gaddis's use of the latter title
        stresses the importance of redemption to his novel. </font></p>
