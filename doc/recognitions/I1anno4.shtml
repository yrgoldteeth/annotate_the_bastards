        [...] around Christmas: </b>Frazer identifies the British
        custom of killing a wren on Saint Stephen's Day (December
        26) as a throwback to pagan scapegoat ceremonies. He
        points out that by many European peoples &quot;the wren
        has been designated the king, the little king, the king
        of birds, the hedge king, and so forth, and has been
        reckoned amongst those birds which it is extremely
        unlucky to kill&quot; (<i>GB </i>536). Graves too notes
        the custom (<i>WG </i>76, 153-55). Commenting on a
        nursery rhyme that reflects this custom, the editors of <i>The
        Annotated Mother Goose</i> note: &quot;There is an old
        tradition that the first Christian missionaries to
        Britain were offended because the pagan druids showed
        great respect for the wren, 'the king of all birds.' The
        missionaries ordered that the wren be hunted and killed
        on the morning of Christmas Day. The custom was later
        transferred to the morning of the following day, December
        26th&quot; (42 n.64). </font></p>

        to dig up the corpse of some one who had drunk himself to
        death and sink it in the nearest swamp or lake, fully

        and varieties of witchcraft, and to set guidelines for
        judges in the prosecution of witches. Exerting a morbid
        fascination, the <i>Malleus</i> (in Montague Summers's

        [...] failed because it was so near good: </b></font>this Roman mystery 
        cult, which might have a connection to the ancient Persian god Mitra (Mithra), 
        became very popular with Roman soldiers and traders of the first century 
        A.D.. The cult centered on Mithras, a deity of sun and light, who was 
        a mediator between the forces of evil and the spirit of heavenly light. 
        What little is known of the mystery religion has been deduced from surviving 
        inscriptions and icons. Under the Roman Empire the religion spread throughout 
        Europe (altars have been found as far north as England) and was the principal 
        rival of Christianity until the end of the fourth century A.D. [<a href="../contributorskey.shtml" target="_blank">AZ</a>]</p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">On the oft-noted
        resemblances between Christianity and Mithraism, W. J.
        Phythian-Adams, whose <i>Mithraism</i> was Gaddis's
        principal source, writes: &quot;To the outward eye the
        two religions of Mithras and Christ appeared to differ in
        accidental details only; at many important points they
        presented the most startling resemblances, which
        Christian apologists admitted with horror, but could not
        explain except by a charge of diabolical agency&quot; (<i>M</i>
        3; cf. 535.43, 536.16 ff., 719.13). At the end of his
        short study, Phythian-Adams concludes - as does Rev.
        Gwyon - &quot;It fell at the last, not because it was
        entirely bad, but <i>because it was so nearly good</i>&quot;
        (<i>M</i> 94). Frazer and Weston also comment on the
        parallels between the two religions (<i>GB </i>358, <i>FRR

        responsible for his or her own salvation, as opposed to
        the Augustinian doctrine (which became dogma) that
        mankind, as a result of Adam's fall, suffers from
        &quot;innate depravity&quot; and can attain salvation
        only by the grace of God (and his church). One of the

        Aristotelian distinction of substance and accident was
        also called in to explain its nature. The substance of
        the bread, it was argued, becomes the substance of the
        flesh, even though the accidents of the bread - <i>e.g., </i>colour,
        size, hardness, taste, weight, smell, etc. - remain; as
        if, forsooth, a bit of bread had any substance apart from
        the entire complex of its attributes. However, the
        substance of the body and blood having, on this view,
        replaced in the act of consecration that of the bread and
        wine, the recipient is declared to masticate, with teeth
        and tongue, the real flesh and blood. It is only by the
        merciful providence of a God unwilling to shock and
        stupefy his worshippers, that the attributes or accidents
        are allowed to remain, and the holy bread or victim, as
        it is called, prevented from appearing on the altar as a
        bleeding mass of raw human flesh.</font></p>
