        symbolism. (Zosimus and all the alchemists that follow
        are named in <i>IP</i> and/or Gaddis's two other major
        sources for alchemy: <i>EB's </i>article
        &quot;Alchemy&quot; [1:534-37] and Mackay's <i>EPD </i>[&quot;The

        one of the first to believe base materials could be

        noted for their metaphysics than their chemistry (<i>IP </i>206,
        217; <i>EPD </i>102-3). As with Albertus Magnus, several
        works ascribed to Geber are forgeries; the practice of
        ascribing a work to a past master was as common with the
        alchemists as it was with early Christian writers.</font></p>

        Valentine&quot; is now known to be a pseudonym, probably
        of Johann Thölden, who published the works ascribed to
        Valentine. The most important of the many writings
        ascribed to him - all of which show a great debt
        (approaching plagiary at times) to Paracelsus - is <i>The

        actually written by Greeks in ancient Alexandria. Jung
        calls Hermes &quot;the Thoth of Hermetic

        With this man, who was a monk of the order of St.

        nearly all his time. [...] They afterwards imagined that
        there was a marvellous virtue in all excrement,

        Mayer, Maier; 1568-1622) was a German physician,
        composer, and voluminous writer on alchemy. Gaddis
        paraphrases Jung's paraphrase of a passage in Majer's <i>De
        Circulo physico quadrato </i>(1616): </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The sun
        has spun the gold in the earth by many millions of
        rotations around it. The sun has gradually imprinted in
        the earth its image, which is the gold. The sun is the
        image of God, and the heart is the image of the sun in
        man. Gold is the sun's image in the earth, and is also
        called <i>deus terrenus; </i>God can be recognized in the
        gold. This image of God appearing in gold is no doubt the
        <i>anima aurea, </i>which, instilled into ordinary
        quicksilver, changes it into gold. (<i>IP </i>246)</font></p>

        spurious - stated that alchemy cannot change species but
        merely imitates them - for instance, colours a metal
        white to make it resemble silver or yellow to give it the
        appearance of gold. He has, he adds, tested gold made by
        alchemists, and found that it will not withstand six or
        seven exposures to fire&quot; (<i>EB </i>1:536).</font></p>

        the oversight of the practices of the midwives,&quot; Dr.
        Haggard notes. &quot;Thus the Dominican monk, Albertus
        Magnus (Albert von Bollstädt, 1193-1280), wrote a book
        for the guidance of midwives, and the Church councils
        passed edicts on their practices. These instructions were
        not, however, for the better care of the child-bearing
        woman, for the relief of her suffering or the prevention
        of her death. They were designed to save the child's life
