        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Fearful
        that the Republic might be utterly destroyed by the
        [Civil War], the Reverend M. R. Watkinson wrote to Salmon
        P. Chase, who was then Secretary of the Treasury under
        Lincoln, pointing out that no mention of the Almighty God
        appeared on our coins. &quot;Antiquarians of succeeding
        generation&quot; might believe, he declared, when they
        examined the coinage of the country, that we were a
        &quot;heathen nation.&quot; Chase promptly wrote to
        Pollock, Director of the Mint: &quot;The trust of our
        people [... as above ...] national recognition.&quot; On
        April 22, 1864 an act was passed authorizing the coinage
        of two-cent bronze pieces with the inscription, &quot;In
        God we trust.&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The
        earliest barbarian that invaded Rome was a Jew. He did
        not thunder at the gates; he went unheralded to the
        Taberna [<i>sic</i>] Meritoria - a squalid inn on the
        Tiber that reeked with garlic - broke his fast, and then
        sauntered forth, as any modern traveler might do, to view
        the city. His first visit was to his compatriots at the
        foot of the Janiculum. To them he whispered something,
        went away, returned and whispered again. After a while he
        spoke out loud. Some of his hearers contradicted him; he
        spoke louder. The peddlars, the rag-pickers, the
        valets-de-place and hook-nosed porters grew tumultuous at
        his words. The ghetto was raided, and a complaint for
        inciting disorder was lodged against a certain Christus,
        of whom nothing was known and who had managed to elude
        arrest.</font></p>

        Giles's retirement to the desert: </b>apparently the
        Saint Giles who died about 712, about whom many legends
        were told. Summers notes &quot;the hermit was companioned
        by a hind which he loved&quot; (<i>PPM </i>68) but gives
        no further details concerning his &quot;retirement.&quot;</font></p>

        Italian operatic soprano who sang often in America in the
        early part of the century. A photograph of Cavalieri as
        Tosca appears in Gustave Kobbé's <i>The Complete Opera
        Book, </i>rev. ed. (New York: Putnam's, 1935), a book
        Gaddis later used for some Wagner references in <i>J R. </i></font></p>

        Geographically it was associated with the Valley of

        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">It might be

        common to both. Also, cf. Sinisterra's &quot;a little

        Hermann Goedsche (under the pseudonym Sir John
