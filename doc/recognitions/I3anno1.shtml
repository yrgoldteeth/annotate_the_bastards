        First of all [...] Clementine </b><b><i>Recognitions</i></b><b>:
        </b>see 373.1 for <i>The Recognitions. </i>In a short
        chapter entitled &quot;Self-Love the Foundation of
        Goodness&quot; (book 3, chap. 53), Peter explains why
        Simon Magus, &quot;whose thoughts are against God, is
        able to do so great marvels&quot;:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">&quot;First
        of all, then, he is evil, in the judgment of God, who
        will not inquire what is advantageous to himself. For how
        can any one love another, if he does not love himself? Or
        to whom will that man not be an enemy, who cannot be a
        friend to himself? In order, therefore, that there might
        be a distinction between those who choose good and those
        who choose evil, God has concealed that which is
        profitable to men, i.e., the possession of the kingdom of
        heaven, and has laid it up and hidden it as a secret
        treasure, so that no one can easily attain it by his own
        power or knowledge. Yet He has brought the report of it,
        under various names and opinions, through successive
        generations, to the hearing of all: so that whosoever
        should be lovers of good, hearing it, might inquire and
        discover what is profitable and salutary to them; but
        that they should ask it, not from themselves, but from
        Him who has hidden it, and should pray that access and
        the way of knowledge might be given to them: which way is
        opened to those only who love it above all the good
        things of this world; and on no other condition can any
        one even understand it, however wise he may seem; but
        that those who neglect to inquire what is profitable and
        salutary to themselves, as self-haters and self-enemies,
        should be deprived of its good things, as lovers of evil
        things.&quot;</font></p>

        </b>contributing to her name may be the biblical Esther,
        the young Jewish woman who becomes queen of Persia and
        saves her people from destruction (subject of Handel's
        oratorio <i>Esther</i>); Ishtar, the Babylonian goddess
        of sexual love with whom Frazer associates the biblical
        Esther (an identification Lang questions); and, less
        likely, the protagonist of Henry Adams's novel <i>Esther</i>
        (1884), a free-thinking young painter who falls in love
        with a clergyman named Stephen Hazard but later breaks

        produced in England in 1846. The first quotation is from
        section 12, where Elijah taunts the priests of Baal to
        call upon their unresponsive god (from 1 Kings 18:26);

        </i>it features an irreligious painter involved in
        criminal activities; lines from the opera are sprinkled
        throughout the novel. (Gaddis once told me he disliked

        oddities ignored by scientists. The first and best known
        of his works, <i>The Book of the Damned</i> (1919), from
        which Wyatt quotes below, is an eccentric attack on
        dogmatism in science. It records unusual objects that
        have fallen from the sky but have not been adequately
        explained, and is written in a unique style that combines
        epigrammatic quasi-philosophy and a droll sense of humor
        with exhaustive listings of data. The principal feature
        of his &quot;supercelestial geography&quot; is a

        scientists for not pursuing &quot;pure science&quot; and
        instead tempering their findings to the needs of society,
        as if &quot;nothing has justification for being, unless
        it serve, or function for, or express the relation of,
        some higher aggregate. So Science functions for and
        serves society at large, and would, from society at
        large, receive no support, unless it did so divert itself
        or dissipate and prostitute itself. It seems by
        prostitution I mean usefulness&quot; (38).</font></p>

        Never did I harm a living creature!<br>
        Whatever misfortunes I encountered<br>
        I sought with secret hand to succor.<br>
        Ever in pure faith<br>
        My prayers rose<br>
        In the holy chapels,<br>
        Ever in pure faith<br>
        I brought flowers to the altar.<br>
        In this hour of pain, why,<br>
        Why, oh Lord, why<br>
        Dost thou repay me thus?</font></p>

        Picasso's [...] </b><b><i>Night Fishing in Antibes</i></b><b>:
        </b>a 1939 work, now in New York's Museum of Modern Art,
        where it was first seen in the exhibit &quot;Masterworks
        Acquired through the Mrs. Simon Guggenheim Fund&quot; (29
        January-23 March 1952). In a letter Gaddis admitted
        &quot;I'd probably have seen it just then (1952) &amp; in
        similar sleepless circumstances&quot; (WG/SM) and allowed
        the anachronism to stand even though <i>R</i>'s

        earlier.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">In
        visual art the aesthetic moment is that flitting instant,
        so brief as to be almost timeless, when the spectator is
        at one with the work of art he is looking at, or with
        actuality of any kind that the spectator himself sees in
        terms of art, as form and colour. He ceases to be his
        ordinary self, and the picture or building, statue,
        landscape, or aesthetic actuality is no longer outside
        himself. The two become one entity; time and space are
        abolished and the spectator is possessed by one
        awareness. When he recovers workaday consciousness it is
        as if he had been initiated into illuminating, exalting,
        formative mysteries. In short, the aesthetic moment is a
        moment of mystic vision.</font></p>
