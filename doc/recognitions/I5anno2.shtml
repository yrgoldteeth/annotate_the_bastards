        reign were so named because of their cropped hair (cf. <i>EPD
        </i>351), but Rodger Cunningham suggests &quot;the main
        reference here is to the old 'eugenic' view of the
        inferiority of brachycephalic non-Nordics.&quot; Cf.

        wife Esme Valerie Eliot), but Gaddis said &quot;her name had no referent&quot; 
        (WG/SM). Esme was based to a large extent upon a painter, poet, and model 
        named Sheri Martinelli (1918-1996); see my &quot;Sheri Martinelli: A Modernist 
        Muse,&quot; <em>Gargoyle</em> 41 (1998): 28-54, and <a href="/recognitions/martinelli/smartinellismoore.shtml">on

        orgone boxes:</b> Austrian psychologist Wilhelm Reich
        (1897-1957) coined the term <i>orgone</i> to refer not
        only to unreleased sexual energy in the individual but to
        energy propelling the cosmos as well. One could
        supposedly tap this cosmic energy - and unblock
        individual energy - by sitting in &quot;orgone
        accumulators&quot; or &quot;orgone boxes,&quot; which
        allegedly could cure cancer and stimulate flagging
        sexuality as well. The United States Food and Drug
        Administration declared the orgone box a fraud. </font></p>

        analysis of Hitler's popularity with the masses, which
        was based largely on Hitler's implicit promise to rid the
        German people &quot;of any oppressive sense of moral
        guilt&quot; (<i>LWW </i>253).</font></p>

        the body was regarded as a pollution of the soul&quot; by early Christians, 
        Haggard notes. &quot;The attitude was expressed by Jerome in the words 
        'Does your skin roughen without bath? Who is once washed in the blood 
        of Christ need not wash again'&quot; (<i>DDD</i> 271). </font></p>

        Teresa went around on all fours [...] I would create it
        for thy sake alone&quot;: </b>Marsh records several
        anecdotes concerning Saint Teresa from the <i>Flos
        Sanctorum </i>(a popular collection of saints' legends),
        concluding: &quot;on another occasion, Christ said to
        her, 'If I had not already created heaven, I would create
        it for thy sake alone;' [...] notwithstanding these
        exalted favors, this saint was so humble that she
        habitually performed menial services in the convent,
        sometimes running about on all fours and carrying a
        pannier of stones on her back, <i>ritu quadrupedis </i>[in
        the manner of a four-legged animal], and with a halter
        around her neck&quot; (<i>MMSM </i>75 n.).</font></p>

        to lie under: </b>commenting on the close connection
        between love and war - specifically, how chivalry adapted
        military terminology - de Rougemont says in a footnote:
        &quot;The German word for 'defeat' is <i>Niederlage, </i>which
        literally means 'in the position of being on the ground,
        of lying under'&quot; (<i>LWW</i> 225 n.1).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>199.44]
        Succubus: </b>a discussion of succubi and incubi occupies
        part 1, questions 3 and 4 of <i>MM</i> (21-31).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>200.4] Not
        for your own delectation [...] a mortal man: </b>&quot;But
        the reason that devils turn themselves into Incubi or
        Succubi is not for the cause of pleasure, since a spirit
        has not flesh and blood; but chiefly it is with this
        intention, that through the vice of luxury they may work
        a twofold harm against men, that is, in body and in soul,
        that so men may be more given to all vices&quot; (<i>MM</i>
        25).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>200.10] Saint
        Augustine. </b><b><i>On the Trinity</i></b><b>: </b>on
        the question &quot;Whether children can be generated by
        Incubi and Succubi,&quot; the authors of <i>MM</i> cite
        Saint Augustine's <i>On the Trinity</i> &quot;that devils
        do indeed collect human semen, by means of which they are
        able to produce bodily effects&quot; (22). </font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>200.14] If
        devils fell from every rank [...] these filthy delights: </b>&quot;Finally,
        since some are believed to have fallen from every order,
        it is not unsuitable to maintain that those devils who
        fell from the lowest choir, and even in that held the
        lowest rank, are deputed to and perform these and other
        abominations&quot; (<i>MM </i>29).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>200.16]
        Helias: </b>as an example &quot;Of those against whom the
        Power of Witches availeth not at all,&quot; <i>MM</i>
        records the following anecdote (93-94):</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Again,
        in the <i>Lives of the Fathers</i> collected by that very
        holy man S. Heraclides, in the book which he calls <i>Paradise,
        </i>he tells of a certain holy Father, a monk named
        Helias. This man was moved by pity to collect thirty
        women in a monastery, and began to rule over them. But
        after two years, when he was thirty years old, he fled
        from the temptation of the flesh into a hermitage, and
        fasting there for two days, prayed to God, saying:
        &quot;O Lord God, either slay me, or deliver me from this
        temptation.&quot; And in the evening a dream came to him,
        and he saw three Angels approach him; and they asked him
        why he had fled from that monastery of virgins. But when
        he did not dare to answer, for shame, the Angels said: If
        you are set free from temptation, will you return to your
        cure of those women? And he answered that he would
        willingly. They then exacted an oath to that effect from
        him, and made him an eunuch. For one seemed to hold his
        hands, another his feet, and the third to cut out his
        testicles with a knife; though this was not really so,
        but only seemed to be. And when they asked if he felt
        himself remedied, he answered that he was entirely
        delivered. So, on the fifth day, he returned to the
        sorrowing women, and ruled over them for the forty years
        that he continued to live, and never again felt a spark
        of that first temptation. </font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>200.18] Saint
        Victor: </b>Saltus notes that through Satan's artifices
        &quot;St. Victor was seduced by a beautiful girl&quot; (<i>AN</i>
        89), but does not identify this saint further.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>200.22] I
        exorcise thee [...] envy: </b>from the Catholic rite of
        exorcism (here with the beer as holy water), as recorded
        in the Roman Ritual: &quot;I exorcise thee, unclean
        spirit, in the name of Jesus Christ; tremble, O Satan,
        thou enemy of the faith, thou foe of mankind, who hast
        brought death into the world, who hast deprived men of
        life, and hast rebelled against justice, thou seducer of
        mankind, thou root of evil, thou source of avarice,
        discord and envy&quot; (<i>EB </i>8:972-73).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>200.36] I am

        that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now
        making the beast with two backs&quot; (<i>Othello</i>
        1.1.116-18) - that is, copulating.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>201.1] God

        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>201.20]
        orchids [...] how they got their name: </b>as late as the
        nineteenth century there were those who &quot;advocated
        the doctrine that all diseases should be treated with
        drugs producing like effects. [...] Thus the root of the
        orchid, because it is shaped like a testicle (in Latin
        the word <i>orchid</i> means testicle), should be used in
        curing diseases of that organ&quot; (<i>DDD</i> 352).
        Significantly, Anselm crushes an orchid underfoot
        (635.35) shortly before castrating himself.</font></p>
