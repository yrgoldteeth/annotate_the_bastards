        Schopenhauer's </b><b><i>Transcendental Speculations on
        Apparent Design in the Fate of the Individual</i></b><b>:
        </b>Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) is considered the
        chief exponent of philosophic pessimism. This title -
        which Wyatt will later force a traveler to take down at
        gunpoint (881.15-34, 887.16-20) - is a book version
        translated by David Irvine (London: Watts, 1913) of an
        essay in Schopenhauer's <i>Parerga und Paralipomena</i>
        (1851). Briefly, Schopenhauer argues that what appears in
        retrospect to be an apparent design in the fate of an
        individual is the result of &quot;the inner guidance, the
        secret pull, which directs everyone accurately to the
        only path suitable for him&quot; and &quot;that the
        systematic connectedness which we believe to have
        apprehended in the events of our lives is no more than an
        unconscious effect of our regulative and schematising
        fantasy&quot; (22, 23).</font></p>

        the loss of one's name was the equivalent of the loss of
        one's soul, and in various myths of the wandering hero,
        there is usually a period where the hero's name is lost
        or concealed. Both the difficulties and advantages of
        allowing Wyatt to go nameless through most of the novel
        were delineated by Gaddis in a note to himself (quoted in
        Koenig's &quot;'Splinters from the Yew Tree,'&quot;

        are troubles with pronouns, especially &quot;he,&quot; in
        those scenes which, when at all extended, the no-hero -
        that is Wyatt, becomes lost or confused. To a strong
        degree this should be so, as, with Valentine (and all the
        others, but pointedly Basil Valentine) he, the no-hero or
        not-yet-hero, is what the other person might be: in
        Valentine's case, the self-who-can-do-more, the creative
        self if it had not been killed by the other, in
        Valentine's case, Reason, in Brown's case, material gain;
        in Otto's case, vanity and ambition; in Stanley's case,
        the Church; in Anselm's case, religion, &amp;c. &amp;c. </font></p>
