        Stylites means &quot;raised on a pillar,&quot; and it was
        on a three-foot-wide platform on a pillar sixty-six feet
        high that he spent the last thirty-seven years of his
        life practicing extreme austerities. Gaddis's details are
        from Haggard (<i>DDD</i> 271):</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">St.
        Simeon Stylites furnishes a most remarkable picture of
        the desert anchorite. He bound a rope around his body so
        tightly that it became imbedded in the flesh, which
        putrefied around it. Worms found their way into the
        corrupt flesh of ulcers that covered his leg. For a year
        during which he stood on one foot he had an associate by
        his side who picked up the worms which fell from his body
        to replace them in the sores, the saint saying to the
        worms, &quot;Eat what God has given you.&quot; At his
        death he was pronounced to be the highest model of a
        Christian saint and an example for the imitation of other
        anchorites.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>826.41] Saint
        Mary of Egypt: </b>again from Haggard (<i>DDD </i>271-72):</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The
        life of one of the anchorites of the desert, St. Mary of
        Egypt, throws light on the attitude of the early
        Christians toward prostitutes. The prostitute could atone
        for her past sins and become a Christian; Christ had
        forgiven Magdalene. Egyptian Mary was a prostitute, but
        she became penitent. She confessed to Zosimus that she
        had practiced her profession for seventeen years at
        Alexandria. Once converted, she took a boat for Jerusalem
        and paid her passage by exercising her calling on board.
        She expiated her sins by a life of penance in the woods.
        For forty-seven years she wandered, black with filth and
        covered only with her white hair; but she spoke to no
        man. To such acts of piety does perversion of sex lead.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><b>827.2] Ana
        Taguza: </b>in a discussion of fake mystics, Summers
        writes: &quot;At Seville on 18th May, 1692, Ana Raguza, a
        Sicilian, was sentenced to seclusion in an enclosed
        convent, and two years exile. This is very lenient
        treatment since she denied the efficacy of Masses and
        Fasting. Moreover she termed herself the Bride of Christ,
        declared that she could detect sinners by the sense of
        smell, and prated of her visions and revelations&quot; (<i>PPM
        </i>205). </font></p>

        On the day of her execution, the populace, struck by her
        gracefulness and beauty, inveighed against the severity
        of her sentence. Their pity soon increased to admiration,
        and, ere evening, she was considered a saint. Her ashes
        were industriously collected; even the charred wood,
        which had aided to consume her, was eagerly purchased by
