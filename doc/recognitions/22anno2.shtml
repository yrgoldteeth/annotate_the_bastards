        then patiently waits for him (and, more importantly,

        man? / Where was I, with God's sigil upon my brow?&quot;
        and Solveig answers: &quot;In my faith, in my hope, and

        a block of rock; the animal is ornamented by a rich
        collar, and pushes with its horns an egg floating in the
        water contained in a cavity of the rock. To explain this
        image, the following is told by the Priests. At the time
        of chaos, before the creation, the world was concealed
        and inert in an egg which floated on the surface of the
        waters. . . . The divine bull image of creative force

        an ostrich egg shell in order to prevent rats coming down

        Wilkinson's <i>Many Bones of Egypt viz: A Popular Account
        of the Ancient Egyptians</i> [1854]); &quot;The
        'Griffin's eggs' were not necessarily ostrich eggs; in

        if her God would grant him the victory. After subduing a
        part of the Alamanni, Clovis went to Reims, where he was
        baptized by St. Remigius on Christmas day 496, together
        with 3,000 Franks. The story of the phial of holy oil
        (the <i>Sainte Ampoule</i>) brought from heaven by a
        white dove for the baptism of Clovis was invented by
        archbishop Hincmar of Reims three centuries after the
