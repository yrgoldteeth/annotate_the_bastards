        Socrates, and Plato, even Homer and Hesiod, had
        plagiarised the best of their wisdom from Moses, and also
        explained away such passages as attributed to the Jewish
        God hands and arms, face and feet, and represented him as
        coming down and walking about in the Garden of Eden.</font></p>

        Council of 1869-70 the dogma of papal infallibility was proclaimed by 
        Pope Pius IX (Pio Nono in Italian). At the final ballot, two votes had 
        remained <i>non placet </i>(&quot;it displeases&quot; - a nay vote): those 
        of an Italian bishop from Naples and Bishop Edward Fitzgerald of Little 
        Rock, Arkansas. Both bishops submitted immediately after the definition

        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">The
        Pope's action in the matter of the Sicilian revolution
        naturally led the Doctor to the reforms which his
        Holiness had introduced into his dominions, and he
        laughed consumedly over the joke which had not long since
        appeared in <i>Punch, </i>to the effect that Pio
        &quot;No, No,&quot; should rather have been named Pio
        &quot;Yes, Yes,&quot; because, as the Doctor explained,
        he granted everything his subjects asked for. Anything
        like a pun went straight to Dr. Skinner's heart.</font></p>

        &quot;mental stagnation&quot; of the seventeenth century:
        &quot;'Give me force and matter,' he cried, 'and I will
        refurbish the world.' Force and matter were not
        forthcoming, but in that magnificent boast was the
        accouchement of modern thought&quot; (<i>AN </i>108).</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">She
        fell in love with the discourses and the life of Crates,
        and would not pay attention to any of her suitors, their
        wealth, their high birth or their beauty. But to her
        Crates was everything. She used even to threaten her
        parents she would make away with herself, unless she were
        given in marriage to him. Crates therefore was implored
        by her parents to dissuade the girl, and did all he
        could, and at last, failing to persuade her, got up, took
        off his clothes before her face and said, &quot;This is
        the bridegroom, here are his possessions; make your
        choice accordingly; for you will be no helpmeet of mine,
        unless you share my pursuits.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Earlier, Crates
        is said to have been converted to the Cynic philosophy
        after &quot;having once, in a certain tragedy, seen
        Telephus holding a date basket, and in a miserable plight
        in other respects&quot; - the only reference to Telephus

        A,M,D,G, [...] Ad Mariam Dei Genetricem: </b>A.M.D.G.
        usually stands for <i>Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam </i>(&quot;For
        the Greater Glory of God&quot; - motto of the Jesuit
        order), but the Latin phrase here translates &quot;To
        Mary Mother of God,&quot; and is apparently from Butler's
        <i>The Way of All Flesh</i> (chap. 28):</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Dr.
        Skinner had lately published a pamphlet upon this subject
        [&quot;a reconciliation between the Churches of England
        and Rome&quot;], which had shown great learning, and had
        attacked the Church of Rome in a way which did not
        promise much hope of reconciliation. He had grounded his
        attack upon the letters A.M.D.G., which he had seen
        outside a Roman Catholic chapel, and which of course
        stood for<i> Ad Mariam Dei Genetricem. </i>Could anything
        be more idolatrous?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">I am
        told, by the way, that I must have let my memory play me
        one of the tricks it often does play me, when I said the
        Doctor proposed <i>Ad Mariam Dei Genetricem</i> as the
        full harmonies, so to speak, which should be constructed
        upon the bass A.M.D.G., for that this is bad Latin, and
        that the doctor really harmonised the letters thus: <i>Ave
        Maria Dei Genetrix. </i>No doubt the doctor did what was
        right in the matter of Latinity - I have forgotten the
        little Latin I ever knew, and am not going to look the
        matter up, but I believe the doctor said <i>Ad Mariam Dei
        Genetricem, </i>and if so we may be sure that <i>Ad
        Mariam Dei Genetricem </i>is good enough Latin at any
        rate for ecclesiastical purposes.</font></p>

        the weariness that comes of a thrice-told tale, that the
        mother of Laou-tze, finding herself one day alone,
        conceived suddenly through the vivifying influence of
        Nature. But though the conception was abrupt, the
        gestation was prolonged, lasting, it is said, eighty-four
        years; and when at last the miraculous child was born,
        his hair was white - whence his name, Laou-tze, the Aged

        attract the passer-by; passing through the court and
        other gates, the entrance to the temple itself was

        </b>this bull, along with Wyatt's golden bull, reflects
        the symbolic importance of the bull to Mithraism. The
        Tauroctonous (&quot;Bull-Slaying&quot;) Mithra is the
        most common subject of Mithraic art, for from the wound
        in the bull's side came all the plants and grains of the
        earth. &quot;What,&quot; Graves notes, &quot;for the
        early Church Councils, seemed the most diabolical and
        unpardonable heresy of all was the identification of the
        Hercules-Dionysus-Mithra bull, whose living flesh the
        Orphic ascetics tore and ate in their initiation
        ceremony, with Jesus Christ whose living flesh was
        symbolically torn and eaten in the Holy Communion&quot; (<i>WG
