        </b>Thomas Kyd's (1558-94) popular Elizabethan play was
        first produced sometime between 1584 and 1589. In the
        second act, Hieronimo's son Horatio is slain by his
        beloved's brother and the prince of Portugal. His body is
        left hanging in the arbor where his father sees it (he is
        mad at this point and has trouble at first recognizing
        the corpse as his son's), utters the quoted lines, and
        vows revenge. The quotation (2.5.85-88) is from a passage
        that, among others, was added to the play at a later date
        by an unknown hand.</font></p>

        hundred years, at which time it would beat its wings
        until a fire started. From the ashes a new phoenix would
        emerge - there was only one in the world at a time - and
        repeat the cycle. (See 700.3 for more details.) &quot;We
        may remark here,&quot; says Lethaby, &quot;that the

        Magic </i>[1946]; but Gaddis's spelling Reichelm
        indicates a different source). Blessed Richalm (d. 1219)
        was abbot of Schönthal in the Neckar Valley; the quoted
        remarks are from his <i>Liber de insidiis dæmonum. </i>(The
        current edition of <i>R</i> has &quot;sunbean,&quot; a

        &quot;from a scurrilous poem formerly attributed to John
        Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, but actually written by John
        Oldham, entitled 'To the Author of a Play called Sodom.'
        Nine lines suffice to give the context of the line in
        question:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Sure
        Nature made, or meant to 'ave don't,<br>

        To gag it up, and make't for ever dumb?<br>

        That tells infection and the Plague is there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Because a
        'merkin' is counterfeit pubic hair for a woman, used to
        hide the effects of syphilis, the line fits into Gaddis'
        theme of falsification; also, the poem itself has been
        the subject of disputes for years, as both it and the
        play it attacks were attributed to Rochester&quot; (67).</font></p>

        ille nates ... puerque</strong>: an epigram from the <em>Priapea</em>, 
        an anonymous collection of verses concerning the Roman fertility god Priapus. 
        The translation by Leonard C. Smithers and Sir Richard Burton (1890) gives 
        the Latin original (slightly different from Gaddis's) followed by two 
        versions of English translation:<br>
        <br>
        <font size="2">Femina si furtum faciet mihi virve puerve,<br>
        haec cunnum, caput hic praebeat, ille nates.<br>

        She shall pay me with coynte, that with his mouth, this with arse.<br>
        <br>
        If a woman, man, or boy, thieve from me, let her coynte, his mouth, the 
        latter's buttocks, be submitted [to my mentule]. </font><br>
        <br>
        Richard W. Hooper's more recent edition, <em>The Priapus Poems</em> (U 
        of Illinois P, 1999), translates the verse thus: &quot;If boy, or man, 
        or woman steals I hump / (in converse order) pussy, head, and rump.&quot; 
        This was a warning placed on the statue of Priapus wealthy Romans kept 
        in their gardens. (Matt Richards found this online at <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/priap/prp21.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/priap/prp21.htm</a>)<br>

        actress who led the life of a prostitute at Antioch. She
        was converted by the holy bishop Nonnus, and disguised as
        a man went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where for many
        years she led a life of extreme mortification and penance
        in a grotto on the Mount of Olives. This
        &quot;bienheureuse pécheresse&quot; attained to such
        heights of sanctity that she was canonized, and in the
        East, where her cult was long very popular, her festival
        is kept on 8 October, which is also the day of her
        commemoration in the Roman Martyrology. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="New York,Times New Roman">Such
        puritanism was too much for human frailty. The baptised,
        in spite of it, must often have relapsed into idolatry,
        homicide, fornication, and other sins; and nearly as
        often have repented. Something had to be done in order to
        reclaim them and restore them to the Church. Rome, as
        always, made the change - in this case most necessary, if
        the Church was to continue to exist. Pope Calixtus,
        therefore, invented about </font><font size="1"

        face="New York,Times New Roman"> 218, a rite of <i>Exhomologesis
        - i.e., </i>of outright confession - which is yet to be
        found in some old service-books; <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>in
        those of the Armenian Church. It was a repetition of the
        rite of baptism, of which all the formalities were
        repeated except the use of water. But this &quot;medicine
        of repentance,&quot; as the rubrics which still exist
        prescribe, could be used only once. If the Christian
        relapsed a second time, then he was really lost.
        Old-fashioned believers, like Tertullian and Hippolytus,
        railed against this innovation, which yet later
        generations found insufficient. Re-admission but once was
        not enough for sinners, and it was found necessary to
        permit it a second and third and fourth time; and finally
        it became the existing sacrament of penitence, which is
        inspired by the very convenient and roomy doctrine that,
        no matter how often and how wilfully a man sins, he can
        always, by confession and penance, expiate his guilt and
        be reconciled to the Church.</font></p>
