## Welcome to Annotate The Bastards!

[williamgaddis.org](http://williamgaddis.org) is an incredibly useful source of information pertaining to 
the novels of [William Gaddis](http://wikipedia.org/William_Gaddis).  However, the information is presented
in a less-than-ideal format.  Currently under development, AtB! will provide a modern web interface on the 
annotation information with mobile browsers being the primary target.  

## About

AtB! is a labor of love developed by [Nicholas Fine](http://ndfine.com).  Born from some personal use
shell scripts while reading *JR*, it seemed that extracting this information into a mobile browser
application could be useful for other readers as they progress through Gaddis' works.  AtB! is being 
developed in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com) and 
is hosted by the inimitable [Heroku](http://heroku.com). As development wraps up, Nicholas also intends 
to release the source code for AtB! on [github](http://github.com).
